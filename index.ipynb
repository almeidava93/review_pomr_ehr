Electronic address: Demetrius.bagley@jefferson.edu.\\n\\nComment in\\n    Urology. 2018 Aug;118:34.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE: To define the need for emergent intervention between patients with \\nsimultaneous bilateral ureteral calculi (SBUC) compared to unilateral ureteral \\ncalculi (UUC). Patients with SBUC represent a potential urological emergency due \\nto possible anuria or electrolyte imbalance. While conventional practice \\nmandates immediate intervention in these patients, little data exist to define \\nthe rate of these events.\\nMETHODS: Records of all patients with ureteral stones treated ureteroscopically \\nover an 11-year period were reviewed to identify those with SBUC. Patient \\npresenting characteristics, time from diagnosis to intervention, and \\npostoperative outcomes were noted. To determine the need for emergent \\nintervention, we compared metabolic and infectious parameters between SBUC \\npatients and age- and sex-matched patients with UUC.\\nRESULTS: A total of 3800 patients presented with ureteral calculi including 42 \\n(1.1%) with SBUC. Two-thirds of patients with SBUC had an established diagnosis \\nof nephrolithiasis. Among the 42 patients with SBUC, 11 (26.2%) were considered \\nemergent due to metabolic (5 of 11, 45.5%), infectious (1 of 11, 9.1%), or both \\nmetabolic and infectious indications (5 of 11, 45.5%). No patients required \\nacute dialysis before surgical intervention. Compared to patients with UUC, \\nthose with SBUC were significantly more likely to require emergent management \\n(P\\u2009=\\u2009.03, odds ratio 2.3). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed this to \\nbe due to anuria (P\\u2009=\\u2009.001) and acidosis (P\\u2009=\\u2009.003).\\nCONCLUSION: SBUC is an uncommon condition and, in this series, only the minority \\nof patients presented emergently. Therefore, patients with SBUC can often be \\nmanaged electively if counseled on clinical signs warranting emergent medical \\nattention. Appropriately selected patients have excellent outcomes following \\nsingle stage bilateral ureteroscopy.\\n\\nCopyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.
