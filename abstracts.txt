Applying methods in natural language processing on electronic health records 
(EHR) data is a growing field. Existing corpus and annotation focus on modeling 
textual features and relation prediction. However, there is a paucity of 
annotated corpus built to model clinical diagnostic thinking, a process 
involving text understanding, domain knowledge abstraction and reasoning. This 
work introduces a hierarchical annotation schema with three stages to address 
clinical text understanding, clinical reasoning, and summarization. We created 
an annotated corpus based on an extensive collection of publicly available daily 
progress notes, a type of EHR documentation that is collected in time series in 
a problem-oriented format. The conventional format for a progress note follows a 
Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan heading (SOAP). We also define a new 
suite of tasks, Progress Note Understanding, with three tasks utilizing the 
three annotation stages. The novel suite of tasks was designed to train and 
evaluate future NLP models for clinical text understanding, clinical knowledge 
representation, inference, and summarization.

Overabundance of information within electronic health records (EHRs) has 
resulted in a need for automated systems to mitigate the cognitive burden on 
physicians utilizing today's EHR systems. We present ProSPER, a Problem-oriented 
Summary of the Patient Electronic Record that displays a patient summary 
centered around an auto-generated problem list and disease-specific views for 
chronic conditions. ProSPER was developed using 1,500 longitudinal patient 
records from two large multi-specialty medical groups in the United States, and 
leverages multiple natural language processing (NLP) components targeting 
various fundamental (e.g. syntactic analysis), clinical (e.g. adverse drug event 
extraction) and summarizing (e.g. problem list generation) tasks. We report 
evaluation results for each component and discuss how specific components 
address existing physician challenges in reviewing EHR data. This work 
demonstrates the need to leverage holistic information in EHRs to build a 
comprehensive summarization application, and the potential for NLP-based 
applications to support physicians and improve clinical care.

Medical documentation arose as individual case reports written for teaching 
purposes. Documentation for patient care later occurred in physicians' personal 
daybooks and only evolved into the individual patient record in the early 20th 
century. Dr. Lawrence Weed improved the utility of the patient record by 
introducing a problem-oriented/subject-object-assessment-plan structure and he 
and other innovators transformed the patient record into electronic form. 
Pediatricians built on these innovations to create a child health electronic 
health record (EHR) for primary care. An American Academy of Pediatrics task 
force formally specified the child-specific needs of the EHR, but much work 
remains to integrate the EHR into the pediatric primary care of the future.

Information Chaos: Software Design and Feasibility Study.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians spend large amounts of their workday using electronic 
medical records (EMRs). Poorly designed documentation systems contribute to the 
proliferation of out-of-date information, increased time spent on medical 
records, clinician burnout, and medical errors. Beyond software interfaces, 
examining the underlying paradigms and organizational structures for clinical 
information may provide insights into ways to improve documentation systems. In 
particular, our attachment to the note as the major organizational unit for 
storing unstructured medical data may be a cause of many of the problems with 
modern clinical documentation. Notes, as currently understood, systematically 
incentivize information duplication and information scattering, both within a 
single clinician's notes over time and across multiple clinicians' notes. 
Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore alternative paradigms for unstructured 
data organization.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of building 
an EMR that does not use notes as the core organizational unit for unstructured 
data and which is designed specifically to disincentivize information 
duplication and information scattering.
METHODS: We used specific design principles to minimize the incentive for users 
to duplicate and scatter information. By default, the majority of a patient's 
medical history remains the same over time, so users should not have to 
redocument that information. Clinicians on different teams or services mostly 
share the same medical information, so all data should be collaboratively shared 
across teams and services (while still allowing for disagreement and nuance). In 
all cases where a clinician must state that information has remained the same, 
they should be able to attest to the information without redocumenting it. We 
designed and built a web-based EMR based on these design principles.
RESULTS: We built a medical documentation system that does not use notes and 
instead treats the chart as a single, dynamically updating, and fully 
collaborative workspace. All information is organized by clinical topic or 
problem. Version history functionality is used to enable granular tracking of 
changes over time. Our system is highly customizable to individual workflows and 
enables each individual user to decide which data should be structured and which 
should be unstructured, enabling individuals to leverage the advantages of 
structured templating and clinical decision support as desired without requiring 
programming knowledge. The system is designed to facilitate real-time, fully 
collaborative documentation and communication among multiple clinicians.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of building a non-note-based, fully 
collaborative EMR system. Our attachment to the note as the only possible atomic 
unit of unstructured medical data should be reevaluated, and alternative models 
should be considered.

BACKGROUND: Since the creation of the problem-oriented medical record, the 
building of problem lists has been the focus of many studies. To date, this 
issue is not well resolved, and building an appropriate contextualized problem 
list is still a challenge.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to present the process of building a shared 
multipurpose common problem list at the Geneva University Hospitals. This list 
aims to bridge the gap between clinicians' language expressed in free text and 
secondary uses requiring structured information.
METHODS: We focused on the needs of clinicians by building a list of uniquely 
identified expressions to support their daily activities. In the second stage, 
these expressions were connected to additional information to build a complex 
graph of information. A list of 45,946 expressions manually extracted from 
clinical documents was manually curated and encoded in multiple semantic 
dimensions, such as International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision; 
International Classification of Primary Care 2nd edition; Systematized 
Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms; or dimensions dictated by specific 
usages, such as identifying expressions specific to a domain, a gender, or an 
intervention. The list was progressively deployed for clinicians with an 
iterative process of quality control, maintenance, and improvements, including 
the addition of new expressions or dimensions for specific needs. The problem 
management of the electronic health record allowed the measurement and 
correction of encoding based on real-world use.
RESULTS: The list was deployed in production in January 2017 and was regularly 
updated and deployed in new divisions of the hospital. Over 4 years, 684,102 
problems were created using the list. The proportion of free-text entries 
decreased progressively from 37.47% (8321/22,206) in December 2017 to 18.38% 
(4547/24,738) in December 2020. In the last version of the list, over 14 
dimensions were mapped to expressions, among which 5 were international 
classifications and 8 were other classifications for specific uses. The list 
became a central axis in the electronic health record, being used for many 
different purposes linked to care, such as surgical planning or emergency wards, 
or in research, for various predictions using machine learning techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: This study breaks with common approaches primarily by focusing on 
real clinicians' language when expressing patients' problems and secondarily by 
mapping whatever is required, including controlled vocabularies to answer 
specific needs. This approach improves the quality of the expression of 
patients' problems while allowing the building of as many structured dimensions 
as needed to convey semantics according to specific contexts. The method is 
shown to be scalable, sustainable, and efficient at hiding the complexity of 
semantics or the burden of constraint-structured problem list entry for 
clinicians. Ongoing work is analyzing the impact of this approach on how 
clinicians express patients' problems.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of problem 
list maintenance at an academic medical center.
SUMMARY: We included problem list data for patients who had at least 2 
face-to-face encounters at Vanderbilt University Medical Center or its clinics 
between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used the frequency of problem 
list additions, resolutions, deletions, duplicate problems (exact and SNOMED CT 
duplicates), inconsistencies (contradicting stages of disease state), and items 
that could be documented elsewhere in the electronic health record as surrogate 
markers of problem list maintenance. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize the results. A total of 546,510 patients met inclusion criteria. There 
were 3,762 (0.7%) patients who had the exact same active problem listed more 
than once. SNOMED CT code duplications occurred in the records for 56,399 
(10.5%) patients. Of the patients with asthma, 2.5% (223/8,779) had 
contradicting asthma stages active on their problem list, and 6.4% (950/14,950) 
of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) had contradicting CKD stages. In 
addition, 17,205 (3.1%) patients had 20,365 active family history problems and 
39,464 (7.2%) patients had an allergy documented on their problem list. On 
average, there were 43.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 14-73.4) additions, 8.7 
(95% CI, 0.1-17.4) resolutions, and 2.1 (95% CI, 0-4.6) deletions of problems 
per 100 face-to-face encounters, inpatient or outpatient.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests areas for improvement for problem list 
maintenance. Further studies into semantic duplication and clinical decision 
support tools to encourage problem list maintenance and deduplication are 
needed.

The problem list is a key facet of the digital patient record that has 
historically been difficult to curate. This paper presents an implementation of 
a contextual problem list using openEHR. It describes the modelling approach, 
key model elements, and how these are assembled to underpin a Problem Oriented 
Medical Record. Finally, it discusses issues associated with how problem lists 
may be used.

Clinicians from different care settings can distort the problem list from 
conveying a patient's actual health status, affecting quality and patient 
safety. To measure this effect, a reference standard was built to derive a 
problem-list based model. Real-world problem lists were used to derive an ideal 
categorization cutoff score. The model was tested against patient records to 
categorize problem lists as either having longitudinal inconsistencies or not. 
The model was able to successfully categorize these events with ~87% accuracy, 
~83% sensitivity, and ~89% specificity. This new model can be used to quantify 
intervention effects, can be reported in problem list studies, and can be used 
to measure problem list changes based on policy, workflow, or system changes.

Improving the Utility of Tobacco-Related Problem List Entries Using Natural 
Language Processing.

Lexington, KY 40506.

We present findings on using natural language processing to classify 
tobacco-related entries from problem lists found within patient's electronic 
health records. Problem lists describe health-related issues recorded during a 
patient's medical visit; these problems are typically followed up upon during 
subsequent visits and are updated for relevance or accuracy. The mechanics of 
problem lists vary across different electronic health record systems. In 
general, they either manifest as pre-generated generic problems that may be 
selected from a master list or as text boxes where a healthcare professional may 
enter free text describing the problem. Using commonly-available natural 
language processing tools, we classified tobacco-related problems into three 
classes: active-user, former-user, and non-user; we further demonstrate that 
rule-based post-processing may significantly increase precision in identifying 
these classes (+32%, +22%, +35% respectively). We used these classes to generate 
tobacco time-spans that reconstruct a patient's tobacco-use history and better 
support secondary data analysis. We bundle this as an open-source toolkit with 
flow visualizations indicating how patient tobacco-related behavior changes 
longitudinally, which can also capture and visualize contradicting information 
such as smokers being flagged as having never smoked.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the epidemiology of male factor infertility and 
identify which types of providers are treating infertile men in the United 
States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was queried 
between 2006 and 2016 for all ambulatory care visits. Men with a diagnosis of 
infertility were identified by international classification of disease coding. 
Comorbidities, demographic and visit information were abstracted from the 
patients' medical record by a combination of trained surveyors and physicians. 
The survey data was weighted to create nationally representative estimates, and 
a combination of Chi-squared and Student's t-tests were utilized to determine 
significance.
RESULT(S): Among the 8.7 billion patient visits between 2006 and 2016, there 
were 3,422,000 male encounters with a diagnosis of male factor infertility. The 
most common provider type for male factor infertility encounters was urology 
(42.12%) followed by primary care (39.79%), gynecology (7.05%) and all other 
provider types (11.01%). A significant number of men seen for infertility had 
comorbidities such as cancer (115,000 men, 3.36%) diabetes (267,000 men, 7.81%), 
depression (301,000 men, 8.8%), and active tobacco use (857,000 men, 30.3%).
CONCLUSION: In a nationally representative sample, more than 50% of ambulatory 
care visits for male factor infertility were not seen by urologists. These men 
also had a significant number of comorbidities for a relatively young cohort, 
emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary care for men with a diagnosis of 
infertility.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist about relatively recent trends in the magnitude 
and characteristics of patients who are re-hospitalized after hospital admission 
for an acute myocardial infarction. This study examined trends in the frequency 
and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of patients readmitted to the 
hospital within 30 days after an initial acute myocardial infarction.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 3116 individuals who were 
hospitalized for a validated first acute myocardial infarction in 6 study 
periods between 2003 and 2015 at the 3 major medical centers in central 
Massachusetts.
RESULTS: The median age of our population was 67 years, and 42% were women. The 
risk of being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after an initial acute 
myocardial infarction increased slightly during the most recent study years 
after controlling for potentially confounding factors. Overall, older adults and 
patients with previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes, 
chronic kidney disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease were at higher 
risk for being readmitted to the hospital than respective comparison groups. For 
those hospitalized in the most recent study years of 2011/2015, a higher risk of 
rehospitalization was associated with a previous diagnosis of chronic kidney 
disease, peripheral vascular disease, the presence of 3 or more chronic 
conditions, and having developed atrial fibrillation or heart failure during the 
patient's hospitalization for a first acute myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified several groups at higher risk for hospital 
readmission in whom enhanced surveillance efforts as well as tailored 
educational and treatment approaches remain needed.

Factors affecting the manual linking of clinical progress notes to problems in 
daily clinical practice: A retrospective quantitative analysis and cross 
sectional survey.

Cillessen F(1), de Vries Robbé P(1), Bor H(1), Biermans M(1).

Author information:
(1)Radboud university medical center, the Netherlands.

This cross sectional study examines how patient characteristics, doctor 
characteristics, and doctors' education and attitudes affect the extent to which 
doctors link progress notes to clinical problems. The independent effects of 
patient characteristics on the linking of notes was examined with a mixed model 
logistic regression. The effects of doctor characteristics and doctors' 
education and attitudes on the link ratio was analyzed with univariate analysis 
of variance. A survey was used to obtain arguments and attitudes on linking 
notes. For "patient characteristics", the odds of linking increased with an 
increase in the number of problems or hospital days, decreased, with an increase 
in the number of involved doctors, medical specialties or the number of notes. 
For "doctor characteristics", the link ratio increased with more work 
experience. For "doctors' education and attitudes", the link ratio increased 
with more familiarity in linking notes and belief in the added value of problem 
oriented charting. "Overview" was the most cited reason for linking; "I don't 
know how" the most cited reason for not linking. There is a huge variation 
within and between all disciplines. Important arguments, for and against, are 
found. Recommendations for policymakers and medical leadership are given to 
maximize the benefits.

BACKGROUND: Accurate, coded problem lists are valuable for data reuse, including 
clinical decision support and research. However, healthcare providers frequently 
modify coded diagnoses by including or removing common contextual properties in 
free-text diagnosis descriptions: uncertainty (suspected glaucoma), laterality 
(left glaucoma) and temporality (glaucoma 2002). These contextual properties 
could cause a difference in meaning between underlying diagnosis codes and 
modified descriptions, inhibiting data reuse. We therefore aimed to develop and 
evaluate an algorithm to identify these contextual properties.
METHODS: A rule-based algorithm called UnLaTem (Uncertainty, Laterality, 
Temporality) was developed using a single-center dataset, including 288,935 
diagnosis descriptions, of which 73,280 (25.4%) were modified by healthcare 
providers. Internal validation of the algorithm was conducted with an 
independent sample of 980 unique records. A second validation of the algorithm 
was conducted with 996 records from a Dutch multicenter dataset including 
175,210 modified descriptions of five hospitals. Two researchers independently 
annotated the two validation samples. Performance of the algorithm was 
determined using means of the recall and precision of the validation samples. 
The algorithm was applied to the multicenter dataset to determine the actual 
prevalence of the contextual properties within the modified descriptions per 
specialty.
RESULTS: For the single-center dataset recall (and precision) for removal of 
uncertainty, uncertainty, laterality and temporality respectively were 100 
(60.0), 99.1 (89.9), 100 (97.3) and 97.6 (97.6). For the multicenter dataset for 
removal of uncertainty, uncertainty, laterality and temporality it was 57.1 
(88.9), 86.3 (88.9), 99.7 (93.5) and 96.8 (90.1). Within the modified 
descriptions of the multicenter dataset, 1.3% contained removal of uncertainty, 
9.9% uncertainty, 31.4% laterality and 9.8% temporality.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a rule-based algorithm named UnLaTem to 
identify contextual properties in Dutch modified diagnosis descriptions. UnLaTem 
could be extended with more trigger terms, new rules and the recognition of term 
order to increase the performance even further. The algorithm's rules are 
available as additional file 2. Implementing UnLaTem in Dutch hospital systems 
can improve precision of information retrieval and extraction from diagnosis

Introduction Electronic Health Record (EHR) adoption rates for office-based 
physicians doubled between 2008 and 2015, from 42% to 89%, and more than 60% of 
all office-based physicians achieved meaningful use by 2016. The US government 
has paid billions of dollars in incentives to promote EHR meaningful use. 
Nonetheless, evidence linking EHR meaningful use to quality measures 
improvements is limited. Objective This study aims to examine the relationship 
between EHR meaningful use and capabilities among four quality measures in an 
ambulatory healthcare setting. Study design A cross-sectional study design of 
the 2015-2016 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey dataset. Methods We used 
adjusted multivariate regression models to examine associations between (a) EHR 
meaningful use and (b) 10 EHR-computerized capabilities, with four quality 
measures (blood pressure screening, tobacco use screening, obesity screening, 
and obesity education). Results We analyzed 30,787 office visits, representing 
an annual estimate of 680 million national office visits. Results showed that 
95% of visits were to offices meeting EHR meaningful use criteria. We found one 
positive association between EHR meaningful use and obesity screening (OR= 3.5, 
95% CI [1.742-6.917]). We also found eight positive associations between EHR 
capabilities and three quality measures (screening for blood pressure and 
obesity, and obesity education). These associations included five 
EHR-computerized capabilities: "record patient problem list", "view lab 
results", "Reminders for interventions/screening", "Order lab results" and 
"Recording clinical notes". No EHR capability was associated with screening for 
tobacco use. Conclusions We looked at a handful of screening-oriented quality 
measures in ambulatory healthcare and found limited associations with EHR 
meaningful use but multiple positively significant associations with EHR 
capabilities. Although EHR meaningful use has become more commonly used, 
offering substantial administrative efficiency over paper records, current 
patterns of EHR meaningful use do not always appear to translate into a better 
quality of care in physician offices. However, quality measures used represent 
limited procedures for a handful of specific conditions and not the overall 
healthcare aspect.

OBJECTIVE: The electronic health record (EHR) data deluge makes data retrieval 
more difficult, escalating cognitive load and exacerbating clinician burnout. 
New auto-summarization techniques are needed. The study goal was to determine if 
problem-oriented view (POV) auto-summaries improve data retrieval workflows. We 
hypothesized that POV users would perform tasks faster, make fewer errors, be 
more satisfied with EHR use, and experience less cognitive load as compared with 
users of the standard view (SV).
METHODS: Simple data retrieval tasks were performed in an EHR simulation 
environment. A randomized block design was used. In the control group (SV), 
subjects retrieved lab results and medications by navigating to corresponding 
sections of the electronic record. In the intervention group (POV), subjects 
clicked on the name of the problem and immediately saw lab results and 
medications relevant to that problem.
RESULTS: With POV, mean completion time was faster (173 seconds for POV vs 205 
seconds for SV; P < .0001), the error rate was lower (3.4% for POV vs 7.7% for 
SV; P = .0010), user satisfaction was greater (System Usability Scale score 58.5 
for POV vs 41.3 for SV; P < .0001), and cognitive task load was less (NASA Task 
Load Index score 0.72 for POV vs 0.99 for SV; P < .0001).
DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that using a problem-based auto-summary has a 
positive impact on 4 aspects of EHR data retrieval, including cognitive load.
CONCLUSION: EHRs have brought on a data deluge, with increased cognitive load 
and physician burnout. To mitigate these increases, further development and 
implementation of auto-summarization functionality and the requisite knowledge 
base are needed.

OBJECTIVE: The dimensions of oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) Oral 
Function, Orofacial Pain, Orofacial Appearance, and Psychosocial Impact are the 
major areas where patients are impacted by oral diseases and dental 
interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dental patients' 
reasons to visit the dentist fit the 4 OHRQoL dimensions.
METHODS: Dentists (N = 1580) from 32 countries participated in a web-based 
survey. For their patients with current oral health problems, dentists were 
asked whether these problems were related to teeth, mouth, and jaws' function, 
pain, appearance, or psychosocial impact or whether they do not fit the 
aforementioned 4 categories. Dentists were also asked about their patients who 
intended to prevent future oral health problems. For both patient groups, the 
proportions of oral health problems falling into the 4 OHRQoL dimensions were 
calculated.
RESULTS: For every 100 dental patients with current oral health problems, 96 had 
problems related to teeth, mouth, and jaws' function, pain, appearance, or 
psychosocial impact. For every 100 dental patients who wanted to prevent future 
oral health problems, 92 wanted to prevent problems related to these 4 OHRQoL 
dimensions. Both numbers increased to at least 98 of 100 patients when experts 
analyzed dentists' explanations of why some oral health problems would not fit 
the four dimension. For the remaining 2 of 100 patients, none of the 
dentist-provided explanations suggested evidence against the OHRQoL dimensions 
as the concepts that capture dental patients' suffering.
CONCLUSION: Oral Function, Orofacial Pain, Orofacial Appearance, and 
Psychosocial Impact capture dental patients' oral health problems worldwide. 
These 4 OHRQoL dimensions offer a psychometrically sound and practical framework 
for patient care and research, identifying what is important to dental patients.

Nashville, Tennessee, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to characterize rates of problem list completeness 
and duplications in common chronic diseases and to identify any relationships 
that they may have with respect to disease type, demographics, and disease 
severity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of electronic 
health record data from Partners HealthCare. We selected 8 common chronic 
diseases and identified patients with each of those diseases. We then analyzed 
each patient's problem list for completeness and duplications and also collected 
information regarding demographics and disease severity. Rates of completeness 
and duplications were calculated for each disease and compared according to 
disease type, demographics, and disease severity.
RESULTS: A total of 327 695 unique patients and 383 404 problem list entries 
were identified. Problem list completeness varied from 72.9% in hypertension to 
93.5% in asthma, whereas problem list duplications varied from 4.8% in 
hypertension to 28.2% in diabetes. There was a variable relationship between 
demographic factors and rates of completeness and duplication. Rates of 
completeness were positively correlated with disease severity for most diseases. 
Rates of duplication were consistently positively correlated with disease 
severity.
CONCLUSIONS: Incompleteness and duplications are both important issues in 
problem lists. These issues vary widely across different diseases and can also 
be impacted by patient demographics and disease severity. Further studies are 
needed to investigate the effect of individual user behaviors and organizational 
policies on problem list utilization, which will aid the development of 
interventions that improve the utility of problem lists.

To keep healthcare effective, accessible and affordable to all we need a 
fundamental paradigm shift. Self-management for prevention and care with the 
help of healthcare professionals, having a shared view of the state of 
well-being, will play a significant role in this transition. The problem list is 
widely adopted as centerpiece of electronic health records and is although often 
patient oriented, but mostly limited to the institutional level. The 
requirements for this paradigm shift has been discussed in a series of 
workshops. Truly person-centered care requires to move towards a holistic 
problem list with an assessment and planning process resulting in an overarching 
care plan. The change process towards a real person-centered problem list, 
integrated in an overarching care plan, should be focused on the transition of 
health services delivery and requires a transition based on the "Quadruple Aim" 
principles.

The Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) is considered a key charting method 
to support clinical care. Although not uniformly represented amongst digital 
health systems, this paper presents a clinical model to represent multiple 
clinical perspectives from a single problem list. The contextual problem list 
model is defined according to primary diagnosis, comorbidities and problems 
arising from the primary condition. It is represented within the patient record 
as a single composition according to the prescribed context. The model pattern 
could help alleviate the traditional criticisms of paper and digitally based 
problem records.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic health records (EHR) comprehend structured and 
unstructured data, that are usually time dependent, enabling the use of 
timelines. However, it is often difficult to display all data without inducing 
information overload. In both clinical usual care and medical research, users 
should be able to quickly find relevant information, with minimal cognitive 
overhead. Our goal was to devise simple visualization techniques for handling 
medical data in both contexts.
METHODS: An abstraction layer for structured EHR data was devised after an 
informal literature review and discussions between authors. The "Heimdall" 
prototype was developed. Two experts evaluated the tool by answering 5 questions 
on 24 clinical cases.
RESULTS: Temporal data was abstracted in three simple types: events, states and 
measures, with appropriate visual representations for each type. Heimdall can 
load and display complex heterogeneous structured temporal data in a 
straightforward way. The main view can display events, states and measures along 
a shared timeline. Users can summarize data using temporal, hierarchical 
compression and filters. Default and custom views can be used to work in 
problem- oriented ways. The evaluation found conclusive results.
CONCLUSION: The "Heimdall" prototype provides a comprehensive and efficient 
graphical interface for EHR data visualization. It is open source, can be used 
with an R package, and is available at https://koromix.dev/files/R.

Factors Influencing Problem List Use in Electronic Health Records-Application of 
the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology.

Institute, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Problem-oriented electronic health record (EHR) systems can help 
physicians to track a patient's status and progress, and organize clinical 
documentation, which could help improving quality of clinical data and enable 
data reuse. The problem list is central in a problem-oriented medical record. 
However, current problem lists remain incomplete because of the lack of end-user 
training and inaccurate content of underlying terminologies. This leads to 
modifications of diagnosis code descriptions and use of free-text notes, 
limiting reuse of data.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate factors that influence acceptance and actual 
use of the problem list, and used these to propose recommendations, to increase 
the value of problem lists for (re)use.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians, heads of 
medical departments, and data quality experts, who were invited through snowball 
sampling. The interviews were transcribed and coded. Comments were fitted in 
constructs of the validated framework unified theory of acceptance user 
technology (UTAUT), and were discussed in terms of facilitators and barriers.
RESULTS: In total, 24 interviews were conducted. We found large variability in 
attitudes toward problem list use. Barriers included uncertainty about the 
responsibility for maintaining the problem list and little perceived benefits. 
Facilitators included the (re)design of policies, improved (peer-to-peer) 
training to increase motivation, and positive peer feedback and monitoring. 
Motivation is best increased through sharing benefits relevant in the care 
process, such as providing overview, timely generation of discharge or referral 
letters, and reuse of data. Furthermore, content of the underlying terminology 
should be improved and the problem list should be better presented in the EHR 
system.
CONCLUSION: To let physicians accept and use the problem list, policies and 
guidelines should be redesigned, and prioritized by supervising staff. 
Additionally, peer-to-peer training on the benefits of using the problem list is 
needed.

Integrating patient-centric indications into the prescribing process: Experience 
at a tertiary academic medical center.

Author information:

Leandro, CA.

PURPOSE: To describe the development of and implementation of a patient-centric 
clinical indications library (CIL) into the prescribing process and determine 
the operational and humanistic outcomes (from prescriber, pharmacist, and 
patient perspectives) of including indications on outpatient prescription 
labels.
METHODS: A descriptive retrospective data analysis was conducted. Multiple 
stakeholder groups were engaged to develop and integrate the CIL into the 
prescription package. After CIL integration, prescribers, pharmacists, and 
patients were surveyed. A focus group discussion consisting of Veterans and 
caregivers was held.
RESULTS: Following implementation of the CIL, the proportion of prescriptions 
associated with an indication increased from 88% to 96%. Surveyed clinicians 
responded that indications helped them better understand a patient's profile 
(61.1% of prescribers and 100% of pharmacists). Among surveyed pharmacists, 
61.5% and 53.8%, respectively, believed that indications helped them catch 
instances of wrong medications and wrong doses ordered. Veterans surveyed found 
that indications on their prescription labels helped them know what their 
medications were for (91.0% of respondents) and why it is important to take 
their medications (70.7%). In focus group discussions, Veterans and family 
members and/or caregivers expressed a preference to see indications that 
describe how a medication works (eg, "to lower blood sugar" vs "for diabetes") 
because they felt that type of phrasing is measurable, action oriented (which 
was appealing due to Veterans' military background), provides surreptitious 
education, and tells the users what to expect.
CONCLUSION: Engaging multidisciplinary stakeholder groups, optimizing the 
electronic health record system, and authorizing pharmacists to add known 
indications to prescriptions increased the number of prescriptions with 
indications, decreased the perceived time spent on order entry and verification, 
and enabled better understanding of each medication's purpose by providers and 
patients.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Temporal trends of healthcare use in the period before 
a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis are poorly understood. We investigated trends 
in respiratory symptoms and LR HRU in the 10 years prior to diagnosis.
METHODS: We analysed a primary care clinical cohort database (UK OPCRD) and 
assessed patients aged ≥40 years who had an electronically coded diagnosis of 
pulmonary fibrosis between 2005 and 2015 and a minimum 2 years of continuous 
medical records prior to diagnosis. Exclusion criteria consisted of electronic 
codes for recognized causes of pulmonary fibrosis such as CTD, sarcoidosis or 
EAA.
RESULTS: Data for 2223 patients were assessed. Over the 10 years prior to 
diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, there was a progressive increase in HRU across 
multiple LR-related domains. Five years before diagnosis, 18% of patients had 
multiple healthcare contacts for LR complaints; this increased to 79% in the 
year before diagnosis, with 38% of patients having five or more healthcare 
contacts.
CONCLUSION: There are opportunities to diagnose pulmonary fibrosis at an earlier 
stage; research into case-finding algorithms and strategies to educate primary 
care physicians is required.

In recent years, the OpenNotes movement and other changes in healthcare have 
driven institutions to make medical records increasingly transparent. As 
patients have begun to question and request changes to their Problem Lists, 
clinicians have come to face the ever more frequent challenge of discerning 
which changes to make and which to refuse. Now clinicians and patients together 
choose the list of problems that represent the patient's current state of health 
and illness. As the physician's role slides closer to consultant and the medical 
paternalism of the twentieth century falls further into the background of our 
technology-infused present, who holds the power of delineating a patient's 
clinical identity? This paper examines the ethical and practical dimensions of 
this question and proposes a research agenda that aims to answer it. Such 
explorations are essential to ensuring that the physician remains relevant to 
patient's notions of health, illness, intervention, and healing.

Towards augmenting structured EHR data: a comparison of manual chart review and 
patient self-report.

Structured electronic health record (EHR) data are often used for quality 
measurement and improvement, clinical research, and other secondary uses. These 
data, however, are known to suffer from quality problems. There may be value in 
augmenting structured EHR data to improve data quality, thereby improving the 
reliability and validity of the conclusions drawn from those data. Focusing on 
five diagnoses related to cardiovascular care, this paper considers the added 
value of two alternative data sources: manual chart abstraction and patient 
self-report. We assess the overall agreement between structured EHR problem list 
data, abstracted EHR data, and patient self- report; and explore possible causes 
of disagreement between those sources. Our findings suggest that both chart 
abstraction and patient self-report contain significantly more diagnoses than 
the problem list, but that the information they capture is different. Methods 
for collecting and validating self-reported medical data require further 
consideration and exploration.

Electronic Health Record and Problem Lists in Leeds, United Kingdom: Variability 
of general practitioners' views.

Data sharing of Electronic Health Records from general practices to secondary 
care in Leeds occurs through the so-called Leeds Care Records, which collects a 
specific set of codes from primary care, known as 'Active Problems', and 
presents it to the user. Variability on its content is a known issue. To explore 
general practitioners' views on their use of 'Active Problems' and on sharing 
data, so lessons could be learnt on how to homogenise and improve shared data. 
Assessing Leeds general practitioners' views through two parallel processes (60 
online surveys and 17 interviews). General practitioners feel they do not have 
the time nor the training required for keeping a shared approach to concise and 
current Problem Lists in electronic patient records. Action is needed to reduce 
current variability, and to improve the quality of shared information. Some 
types of codes currently present in Problem Lists have very little support among 
general practitioners who consider the focus should be on long-term conditions 
and probably adding current acute diagnoses and life expectancy items and not 
omitting sensitive information. There is a perceived need of training and time 
to update Problem Lists if their quality is to improve.

USA.

OBJECTIVE: Long problem lists can be challenging to use. Reorganisation of the 
problem list by organ system is a strategy for making long problem lists more 
manageable.
METHODS: In a small-town primary care setting, we examined 4950 unique problem 
lists over 5 years (24 033 total problems and 2170 unique problems) from our 
electronic health record. All problems were mapped to the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and 
SNOMED CT codes. We developed two different algorithms for reorganising the 
problem list by organ system based on either the ICD-10-CM or the SNOMED CT 
code.
RESULTS: The mean problem list length was 4.9±4.6 problems. The two 
reorganisation algorithms allocated problems to one of 15 different categories 
(12 aligning with organ systems). 26.2% of problems were assigned to a more 
general category of 'signs and symptoms' that did not correspond to a single 
organ system. The two algorithms were concordant in allocation by organ system 
for 90% of the unique problems. Since ICD-10-CM is a monohierarchic 
classification system, problems coded by ICD-10-CM were assigned to a single 
category. Since SNOMED CT is a polyhierarchical ontology, 19.4% of problems 
coded by SNOMED CT were assigned to multiple categories.
CONCLUSION: Reorganisation of the problem list by organ system is feasible using 
algorithms based on either ICD-10-CM or SNOMED CT codes, and the two algorithms 
are highly concordant.

A Daily Hospital Progress Note that Increases Physician Usability of the 
Electronic Health Record by Facilitating a Problem-Oriented Approach to the 
Patient and Reducing Physician Clerical Burden.

Sutton JM(1), Ash SR(1), Al Makki A(1), Kalakeche R(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Nephrology, Indiana University Health, Lafayette.

We suggest changes in the electronic health record (EHR) in hospitalized 
patients to increase EHR usability by optimizing the physician's ability to 
approach the patient in a problem-oriented fashion and by reducing physician 
data entry and chart navigation. The framework for these changes is a 
Physician's Daily Hospital Progress Note organized into 3 sections: Subjective, 
Objective, and a combined Assessment and Plan section, subdivided by problem 
titles. The EHR would consolidate information for each problem by: 1) 
juxtaposing to each problem title relevant medications, key durable results, and 
limitations; 2) entering in the running lists under Assessment and Plan the most 
relevant information for that day, including abbreviated versions of relevant 
reports; and 3) generating a flow sheet in a problem's progress note for any key 
results tracked daily. To reduce physician EHR navigation, the EHR would place 
in the Objective section abbreviated versions of notes of other physicians, 
nurses, and allied health professionals as well as recent orders. The physician 
would enter only the analysis and plan and new information not included in the 
EHR. The consolidation of information for each problem would facilitate 
physician communication at points of transition of care including generation of 
a problem-oriented discharge summary.

The EHR problem list has the potential to support care coordination among the 
multidisciplinary care team that cares for pediatric trauma patients. To realize 
this potential, the need exists to ensure appropriate utilization by formulating 
acceptable usage and management policy. In this regard, understanding the 
prevailing utilization pattern is pivotal. To this end, we analyzed EHR in 
tandem with trauma registry data at a Level I pediatric trauma center. Almost 
all (97.8%) of the actions executed on the problem list were addition of items. 
Among the 517 patient encounters in the cohort, 263 (48.9%) encounters involving 
sicker patients had at least one problem list item added, mostly within the 
first 4 hours of arrival, while in the emergency department, and by providers in 
the service of record. This represents a foundation to build upon. Subsequent 
research will explore completeness, accuracy, and the impact of the utilization 
on patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: This study examined differences by age in suicide risk screening and 
clinical actions to reduce suicide risk among patients with visits to Veterans 
Health Administration (VHA) medical facilities in the year prior to an attempt.
METHODS: Ninety-three VHA patient records were reviewed specific to the last 
visit before an attempt. Information was extracted regarding documentation of 
individual suicide risk factors and provider actions to reduce risk.
RESULTS: The authors examined differences by patient age (≥50 versus 18-49). 
Older patients' medical records were less likely to have evidence of 1) 
screening for impulsivity and firearms access and 2) engagement in safety 
planning, referrals for mental health services, and consideration of psychiatric 
hospitalization. General medical providers were less likely to document these 
risk factors and action steps in comparison with mental health clinicians.
CONCLUSION: Lethal means education and collaborative care are universal 
strategies that may improve identification of and lower suicide risk in older 
veterans.

It's Time to Wikify Clinical Documentation: How Collaborative Authorship Can 
Reduce the Burden and Improve the Quality of the Electronic Health Record.

Electronic health records (EHRs) have become ubiquitous tools and represent the 
standard of care for 96% of hospitals and 86% of ambulatory physicians in the 
United States. With adoption of EHRs came the promise of improved efficiency, 
higher-quality care, and lower costs. Unfortunately, some clinicians are now 
spending twice as much time on documentation as they spend seeing patients, and 
the documentation paradigm of problem-oriented medical records is contributing 
to this imbalance. It is time to consider new innovations. The collaborative 
wiki format offers many opportunities to ease the burden of documentation as 
well as to increase the usefulness of the recorded clinical data. Wikis support 
multiple authorship, have built-in features to track edits and changes, allow 
for contextual linkages (e.g., linking medical problems to their treatment), and 
support new technologies such as application programming interfaces, which allow 
for safe and secure exchange of information. In this Perspective, the authors 
describe the rationale for considering this approach to clinical documentation 
and propose a pilot to learn about its effectiveness. They believe wiki-based 
documentation will become increasingly attractive, especially as new legislation 
and directives from policymakers seek to reduce the crushing documentation 
burden and as the U.S. health care system transitions from an episode-based 
payment structure to a value-based, outcomes-focused system.

Caveats for the Use of the Active Problem List as Ground Truth for Decision 
Support.

Ceusters W(1), Blaisure J(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Biomedical Informatics, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 
USA.

Diagnoses recorded on the problem list are increasingly being used for decision 
support applications. To obtain insight in the adequacy of the clinical user 
interface to capture what the clinician has in mind, and to reconstruct the 
clinical reality of the patient, we analyzed in the database of an EHR system 
the transactions that resulted from managing the problem list. Our findings 
indicate (1) that caution is required when using the evolution of the problem 
list for determining comorbidity or ongoing disease, and (2) that similarities 
or differences in problem list annotation sequences do not always correspond 
with similarities resp. differences in disease courses. It is to be investigated 
whether automatically identifiable subsets of problem list evolution patterns 
exist from which ground truth reliably can be inferred or whether clinicians 
need more education in how problem list user interfaces should be used to avoid 
erroneous interpretations by clinical decision support applications.

PURPOSE: The extent to which medication prescriptions had a reason for the 
medication use documented in form of a potential indication within the 
electronic health record (EHR) problem lists using a MEDication Indication 
(MEDI) resource was evaluated.
METHODS: Prescriptions from January 1 to June 30, 2015, comparing them to 
patients' problem lists using MEDI and the MEDI High Precision Subset (MEDI-HPS) 
were analyzed. RxNorm generic ingredient name codes in MEDI were used to map 
prescriptions to problems using codes from the International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th edition. A reference standard was established to evaluate the MEDI 
precision and recall by having 2 pharmacists independently manually review 
prescriptions and problem lists from 30 randomly selected patients.
RESULTS: For 62,191 patients, 61% of prescriptions matched a potential 
indication on the patient's problem list using MEDI, whereas only 38% had a 
match using MEDI-HPS. The precision of MEDI compared to the reference standard 
was 47% with a recall of 57%, whereas MEDI-HPS had a precision of 79% and recall 
of 96%. Secondary analysis excluding medication prescribed with a supply of ≤14 
days gave slightly better, yet not significant, results.
CONCLUSION: Analysis of patient records found most patients did not have an 
indication listed in the EHR problem list that would match a specific 
medication, suggesting that the problem lists may be incomplete. When using 
MEDI, 61% of prescriptions matched to the problem list, compared with only 38% 
using MEDI-HPS. Likewise, 37% of problems matched to prescriptions when using 
MEDI, compared with only 21% using MEDI-HPS.

OBJECTIVE: To define the need for emergent intervention between patients with 
simultaneous bilateral ureteral calculi (SBUC) compared to unilateral ureteral 
calculi (UUC). Patients with SBUC represent a potential urological emergency due 
to possible anuria or electrolyte imbalance. While conventional practice 
mandates immediate intervention in these patients, little data exist to define 
the rate of these events.
METHODS: Records of all patients with ureteral stones treated ureteroscopically 
over an 11-year period were reviewed to identify those with SBUC. Patient 
presenting characteristics, time from diagnosis to intervention, and 
postoperative outcomes were noted. To determine the need for emergent 
intervention, we compared metabolic and infectious parameters between SBUC 
patients and age- and sex-matched patients with UUC.
RESULTS: A total of 3800 patients presented with ureteral calculi including 42 
(1.1%) with SBUC. Two-thirds of patients with SBUC had an established diagnosis 
of nephrolithiasis. Among the 42 patients with SBUC, 11 (26.2%) were considered 
emergent due to metabolic (5 of 11, 45.5%), infectious (1 of 11, 9.1%), or both 
metabolic and infectious indications (5 of 11, 45.5%). No patients required 
acute dialysis before surgical intervention. Compared to patients with UUC, 
those with SBUC were significantly more likely to require emergent management 
(P = .03, odds ratio 2.3). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed this to 
be due to anuria (P = .001) and acidosis (P = .003).
CONCLUSION: SBUC is an uncommon condition and, in this series, only the minority 
of patients presented emergently. Therefore, patients with SBUC can often be 
managed electively if counseled on clinical signs warranting emergent medical 
attention. Appropriately selected patients have excellent outcomes following 
single stage bilateral ureteroscopy.

Moving From Problem-Oriented to Goal-Directed Health Records.

Electronic health records (EHRs) have been in place for decades; however, most 
existing systems were designed in the prevailing disease- and payment-focused 
care paradigm that often loses sight of the goals, needs, and values of patients 
and clinicians. The goal-directed health care model was proposed more than 20 
years ago, but no design principles have been developed for corresponding 
electronic record systems. Newly designed EHRs are needed to facilitate health 
care that is anchored by patient life and health goals. We explore the 
limitations of current EHRs and propose a blueprint for a new EHR design that 
may facilitate goal-directed health care. To reflect patient goals as a thread 
through the care continuum, we propose 5 major system functions for 
goal-directed health records based on the 8 characteristics of primary health 
care defined by the Institute of Medicine. We also discuss how new EHR functions 
could support goal-directed health care and how payment and quality measurement 
systems will need to be transformed. It may be possible for patient life and 
health goals to drive health care that is reinforced by a corresponding health 
record design; however, synchronized shifts must occur in the models of 
providing, documenting, and paying for health care.

Impact of problem-based charting on the utilization and accuracy of the 
electronic problem list.

CA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Problem-based charting (PBC) is a method for clinician documentation 
in commercially available electronic medical record systems that integrates note 
writing and problem list management. We report the effect of PBC on problem list 
utilization and accuracy at an academic intensive care unit (ICU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An interrupted time series design was used to assess the 
effect of PBC on problem list utilization, which is defined as the number of new 
problems added to the problem list by clinicians per patient encounter, and of 
problem list accuracy, which was determined by calculating the recall and 
precision of the problem list in capturing 5 common ICU diagnoses.
RESULTS: In total, 3650 and 4344 patient records were identified before and 
after PBC implementation at Stanford Hospital. An increase of 2.18 problems 
(>50% increase) in the mean number of new problems added to the problem list per 
patient encounter can be attributed to the initiation of PBC. There was a 
significant increase in recall attributed to the initiation of PBC for sepsis 
(β = 0.45, P < .001) and acute renal failure (β = 0.2, P = .007), but not for 
acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, or venous thromboembolism.
DISCUSSION: The problem list is an underutilized component of the electronic 
medical record that can be a source of clinician-structured data representing 
the patient's clinical condition in real time. PBC is a readily available tool 
that can integrate problem list management into physician workflow.
CONCLUSION: PBC improved problem list utilization and accuracy at an academic 
ICU.

An accurate and updated problems' list is critical in a problem-oriented 
Electronic Health Record (EHR). The lack of organization and maintenance of the 
problems limits its value. Certain problems have a larger effect on the clinical 
evolution of the patient, these are known as Comorbidities. The aim of this 
paper is to evaluate the impact of the automatic loading of comorbidities in the 
organization and maintenance of inpatient problems' list using a comorbidities 
subset.

There is no consensus among health professionals on how to structure medical 
records to serve clinical decision-making. Three approaches co-exist 
(source-oriented, problem-oriented, goal-oriented), each suiting a different 
subset of patients. In primary care, the problem-oriented approach is dominant, 
but for patients with multiple conditions (multimorbidity) the goal-oriented 
approach seems more appropriate. There is a need to combine different approaches 
in one medical-record system. In this article, we explain some misconceptions 
about 'problems' and 'goals' that hinder the way to consensus. When putting the 
approaches into historical perspective, it becomes evident that each relates to 
a different definition of health. Each approach has its specific merits that 
should be preserved even when health definitions change. Hence, we combine the 
merits of each approach into one overarching model, as to show the way to a new 
generation of electronic medical-record systems that can serve all patients. 
This model has three levels: a level of problems, diseases, and patient goals, a 
level of (shared) objectives, and a level of action plans and results.

Rendering Problem-Oriented CCD for chronic diseases.

Sungchul Bae, Do-Youn Lee, Il Kon Kim.

Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based clinical document standard 
designed to ensure data exchange as well as semantic interoperability of 
healthcare information systems. Continuity care of documents (CCD), a template 
derived from CDA, is designed with the goal of displaying patient records more 
intuitively for clinicians, especially for when the patient has a long history 
of medical care.The rate of chronic patients in the general population has 
increased as longevity has increased substantially in the past few decades, and 
the trend towards longer and more complex medical records has made it 
time-consuming to read patient data even in the CCD document. The 
problem-oriented medical record (POMR) is an easily readable medical record 
style and it has been widely adopted in electronic health record (EHR) services 
in Europe. Unfortunately, POMR has not been integrated with the CCD-compatible 
representation so far. Hence this paper proposes Problem-Oriented CCD (PO-CCD) 
rendering based on CDA and POMR. To find out how a PO-CCD would be viewed by 
healthcare professionals and healthcare IT professionals, we drafted a few 
Problem-oriented CCD example documents and conducted a survey on their 
impression. Among our 41 respondents, 60% replied they would like to view 
patient charts in our Problem-Oriented CCD rendering side-by-side with the 
conventional CCD rather than the conventional CCD alone.

OBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations on how to most effectively implement 
advanced features of acute care patient portals, including: (1) patient-provider 
communication, (2) care plan information, (3) clinical data viewing, (4) patient 
education, (5) patient safety, (6) caregiver access, and (7) hospital amenities.
RECOMMENDATIONS: We summarize the experiences of 6 organizations that have 
implemented acute care portals, representing a variety of settings and 
technologies. We discuss the considerations for and challenges of incorporating 
various features into an acute care patient portal, and extract the lessons 
learned from each institution's experience. We recommend that stakeholders in 
acute care patient portals should: (1) consider the benefits and challenges of 
generic and structured electronic care team messaging; (2) examine strategies to 
provide rich care plan information, such as daily schedule, problem list, care 
goals, discharge criteria, and post-hospitalization care plan; (3) offer 
increasingly comprehensive access to clinical data and medical record 
information; (4) develop alternative strategies for patient education that go 
beyond infobuttons; (5) focus on improving patient safety through explicit 
safety-oriented features; (6) consider strategies to engage patient caregivers 
through portals while remaining cognizant of potential Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) violations; (7) consider offering 
amenities to patients through acute care portals, such as information about 
navigating the hospital or electronic food ordering.

OBJECTIVE: An accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date problem list can help 
clinicians provide patient-centered care. Unfortunately, problem lists created 
and maintained in electronic health records by providers tend to be inaccurate, 
duplicative and out of date. With advances in machine learning and natural 
language processing, it is possible to automatically generate a problem list 
from the data in the EHR and keep it current. In this paper, we describe an 
automated problem list generation method and report on insights from a pilot 
study of physicians' assessment of the generated problem lists compared to 
existing providers-curated problem lists in an institution's EHR system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The natural language processing and machine 
learning-based Watson1 method models clinical thinking in identifying a 
patient's problem list using clinical notes and structured data. This pilot 
study assessed the Watson method and included 15 randomly selected, 
de-identified patient records from a large healthcare system that were each 
planned to be reviewed by at least two internal medicine physicians. The 
physicians created their own problem lists, and then evaluated the overall 
usefulness of their own problem lists (P), Watson generated problem lists (W), 
and the existing EHR problem lists (E) on a 10-point scale. The primary outcome 
was pairwise comparisons of P, W, and E.
RESULTS: Six out of the 10 invited physicians completed 27 assessments of P, W, 
and E, and in process evaluated 732 Watson generated problems and 444 problems 
in the EHR system. As expected, physicians rated their own lists, P, highest. 
However, W was rated higher than E. Among 89% of assessments, Watson identified 
at least one important problem that physicians missed.
CONCLUSION: Cognitive computing systems like this Watson system hold the 
potential for accurate, problem-list-centered summarization of patient records, 
potentially leading to increased efficiency, better clinical decision support, 
and improved quality of patient care.

Problem-oriented charting is form of medical documentation that organizes 
patient data by a diagnosis or problem. In this review, we discuss the history 
and current use of problem-oriented charting by critically evaluating the 
literature on the topic. We provide insights with regard to our own 
institutional use of problem-oriented charting and potential opportunities for 
research.

A hospital-wide transition from paper to digital problem-oriented clinical 
notes. A descriptive history and cross-sectional survey of use, usability, and 
satisfaction.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use, usability, and physician satisfaction of a 
locally developed problem-oriented clinical notes application that replaced 
paper-based records in a large Dutch university medical center.
METHODS: Using a clinical notes database and an application event log file and a 
cross-sectional survey of usability, authors retrospectively analyzed system 
usage for medical specialties, users, and patients over 4 years. A standardized 
questionnaire measured usability. Authors analyzed the effects of sex, age, 
professional experience, training hours, and medical specialty on user 
satisfaction via univariate analysis of variance. Authors also examined the 
correlation between user satisfaction in relation to users' intensity of use of 
the application.
RESULTS: In total 1,793 physicians used the application to record progress notes 
for 219,755 patients. The overall satisfaction score was 3.2 on a scale from 1 
(highly dissatisfied) to 5 (highly satisfied). A statistically significant 
difference occurred in satisfaction by medical specialty, but no statistically 
significant differences in satisfaction took place by sex, age, professional 
experience, or training hours. Intensity of system use did not correlate with 
physician satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: By two years after the start of the implementation, all medical 
specialties utilized the clinical notes application. User satisfaction was 
neutral (3.2 on a 1-5 scale). Authors believe that the significant factors 
facilitating this transition mirrored success factors reported by other groups: 
a generic, consistent, and transparent design of the application; intensive 
collaboration; continuous monitoring; and an incremental rollout.

Improving Communication with Primary Care Physicians at the Time of Hospital 
Discharge.

Destino LA, Dixit A, Pantaleoni JL, Wood MS, Pageler NM, Kim J, Platchek TS.

BACKGROUND: Communication with primary care physicians (PCPs) at the time of a 
patient's hospital discharge is important to safely transition care to home. The 
goal of this quality improvement initiative was to increase discharge 
communication to PCPs at an academic children's hospital.
METHODS: A multidisciplinary team at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford 
used Lean A3 problem solving methodology to address the problem of inadequate 
discharge communication with PCPs. Emphasis was placed on frontline provider 
(resident physicians) involvement in the improvement process, creating 
standards, and error proofing. Root cause analysis identified several key 
drivers of the problem, and successive countermeasures were implemented 
beginning in August 2013 aimed at achieving the target of 80% attempted verbal 
communication within seven days before or after (usually 24-48 hours) on the 
pediatric medical services. Run charts were generated tracking the outcome of 
PCP communication.
RESULTS: On the pediatric medical services, the goal of 80% communication was 
met and sustained during a seven-month period starting October 2013, a 
statistically significant improvement. In the eight months prior to October 
2013, hospitalwide PCP communication prior to discharge averaged 59.1% 
(n = 5,397) and improved to 76.7% (n = 4,870) in the seven months after 
(p <0.001). Fifteen of 19 specialty services had a significant increase in 
discharge communication after October 2013.
CONCLUSION: Lean improvement methodology (including structured problem solving 
using A3 thinking), intensive frontline provider involvement, and 
process-oriented electronic health record work flow redesign led to increased 
verbal PCP communication at around the time of a patient's discharge.

BACKGROUND: The integration of clinical decision support (CDS) in documentation 
practices remains limited due to obstacles in provider workflows and design 
restrictions in electronic health records (EHRs). The use of electronic 
problem-oriented templates (POTs) as a CDS has been previously discussed but not 
widely studied.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the voluntary use of evidence-based POTs as a CDS on 
documentation practices.
METHODS: This was a randomized cohort (before and after) study of Hospitalist 
Attendings in an Academic Medical Center using EPIC EHRs. Primary Outcome 
measurement was note quality, assessed by the 9-item Physician Documentation 
Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). Secondary Outcome measurement was physician 
efficiency, assessed by the total charting time per note.
RESULTS: Use of POTs increased the quality of note documentation [score 37.5 vs. 
39.0, P = 0.0020]. The benefits of POTs scaled with use; the greatest 
improvement in note quality was found in notes using three or more POTs [score 
40.2, P = 0.0262]. There was no significant difference in total charting time 
[30 minutes vs. 27 minutes, P = 0.42].
CONCLUSION: Use of evidence-based and problem-oriented templates is associated 
with improved note quality without significant change in total charting time. It 
can be used as an effective CDS during note documentation.

Determinants of a successful problem list to support the implementation of the 
problem-oriented medical record according to recent literature.

BACKGROUND: A problem-oriented approach is one of the possibilities to organize 
a medical record. The problem-oriented medical record (POMR) - a structured 
organization of patient information per presented medical problem- was 
introduced at the end of the sixties by Dr. Lawrence Weed to aid dealing with 
the multiplicity of patient problems. The problem list as a precondition is the 
centerpiece of the problem-oriented medical record (POMR) also called 
problem-oriented record (POR). Prior to the digital era, paper records presented 
a flat list of medical problems to the healthcare professional without the 
features that are possible with current technology. In modern EHRs a POMR based 
on a structured problem list can be used for clinical decision support, 
registries, order management, population health, and potentially other 
innovative functionality in the future, thereby providing a new incentive to the 
implementation and use of the POMR.
METHODS: On both 12 May 2014 and 1 June 2015 a systematic literature search was 
conducted. From the retrieved articles statements regarding the POMR and related 
to successful or non-successful implementation, were categorized. Generic 
determinants were extracted from these statements.
RESULTS: In this research 38 articles were included. The literature analysis led 
to 12 generic determinants: clinical practice/reasoning, complete and accurate 
problem list, data structure/content, efficiency, functionality, 
interoperability, multi-disciplinary, overview of patient information, quality 
of care, system support, training of staff, and usability.
CONCLUSIONS: Two main subjects can be distinguished in the determinants: the 
system that the problem list and POMR is integrated in and the organization 
using that system. The combination of the two requires a sociotechnical approach 
and both are equally important for successful implementation of a POMR. All the 
determinants have to be taken into account, but the weight given to each of the 
determinants depends on the organizationusing the problem list or POMR.

OBJECTIVES: Complete patient problem lists may improve the quality of care. To 
improve the completeness of the lists at our institution, we implemented the 
coded problem list entry subsystem (CPLES) in our electronic medical record 
system. Subsequently, physicians used the CPLES instead of handwritten notes to 
document coded problem lists and progress notes. We evaluated the effect of 
implementing the CPLES on the completeness of problem lists.
METHODS: We compared the completeness of coded problem lists input after CPLES 
implementation with that of problem lists handwritten before CPLES 
implementation and determined the differences. Moreover, the efficiency and 
usability of the CPLES were evaluated.
RESULTS: The efficiency and usability of CPLES were acceptable. However, the 
completeness of problem lists was reduced after CPLES implementation. The 
possible reasons for this reduction, namely system usability, efficacy, 
incentives, leadership, and education, were crucial for successful CPLES 
implementation and are discussed in the text.
CONCLUSION: CPLES implementation reduced the completeness of problem lists. 
Institutions may learn from our experience and carefully implement their own 
coded problem list systems to avoid this consequence.

BACKGROUND: Despite awareness of the negative health and financial outcomes of 
delirium, systems to routinely assess and manage the condition are absent in 
clinical practice. We report the development and pilot evaluation of a Delirium 
Early Monitoring System (DEMS), designed to be completed by non-medical staff to 
influence clinical processes within inpatient settings. Two versions of the DEMS 
are described based on a modified Confusion Assessment Method (DEMS-CAM) and 
Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DEMS-DOSS).
METHODS: Both versions of DEMS were piloted on a 20-bedded Psychogeriatric ward 
over 6 weeks. Training was administered to ward staff on the use of each version 
of the DEMS and data were collected via electronic medical records and completed 
assessment sheets. The primary outcome was patterns of DEMS use and the 
secondary outcome was the initiation of delirium management protocols. Data 
regarding the use of the DEMS DOSS and DEMS CAMS were analyzed using χ 2 tests.
RESULTS: Completion rates for the DEMS CAM and DEMS DOSS were 79% and 68%, 
respectively. Non-medical staff were significantly more likely to use the 
DEMS-CAM as part of daily practice as opposed to the DEMS-DOSS (p<0.001). 
However, there was no difference between the use of the DEMS-CAM and DEMS-DOSS 
in triggering related actions such as documentation of assessment scores in 
patients' medical records and implementation of delirium management protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: This real world evaluation revealed that non-medical staff were 
able to incorporate delirium monitoring into their practice, on the majority of 
occasions, as part of their daily working routine. Further research is necessary 
to determine if the routine use of the DEMS can lead to improved understandings 
and practice of non-medical staff regarding delirium detection.

OBJECTIVE: To determine problem list completeness related to chronic diseases in 
electronic medical records (EMRs) and explore clinic and physician factors 
influencing completeness.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of primary care EMR data quality related to 
seven chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, congestive heart 
failure, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disorder) in Manitoba, Canada. We included 119 practices in 18 primary 
care clinics across urban and rural Manitoba. The main outcome measure was EMR 
problem list completeness. Completeness was measured by comparing the number of 
EMR-documented diagnoses to the number of billings associated with each disease. 
We calculated odds ratios for the effect of clinic patient load and salary type 
on EMR problem list completeness of the 7 chronic diseases.
RESULTS: Completeness of EMR problem list for each disease varied widely among 
clinics. Factors that significantly affected EMR problem list completeness 
included the primary care provider, the patient load, and the clinic's funding 
and organization model (ie, salaried, fee-for-service, or residency training 
clinics). Average rates of completeness were: hypertension, 72%; diabetes, 80%; 
hypothyroidism, 63%; asthma, 56%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, 43%; 
congestive heart failure, 54%; and coronary artery disease, 64%.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the high variability but generally low 
quality of problem lists (health condition records) related to 7 common chronic 
diseases in EMRs. There are systematic physician- and clinic-level factors 
associated with low data quality completeness. This information may be useful to 
support improvement in EMR data quality in primary care.

OBJECTIVE: Quantify the variability of patients' problem lists - in terms of the 
number, type, and ordering of problems - across multiple physicians and assess 
physicians' criteria for organizing and ranking diagnoses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an experimental setting, 32 primary care physicians 
generated and ordered problem lists for three identical complex internal 
medicine cases expressed as detailed 2- to 4-page abstracts and subsequently 
expressed their criteria for ordering items in the list. We studied variability 
in problem list length. We modified a previously validated rank-based similarity 
measure, with range of zero to one, to quantify agreement between pairs of lists 
and calculate a single consensus problem list that maximizes agreement with each 
physician. Physicians' reasoning for the ordering of the problem lists was 
recorded.
RESULTS: Subjects' problem lists were highly variable. The median problem list 
length was 8 (range: 3-14) for Case A, 10 (range: 4-20) for Case B, and 7 
(range: 3-13) for Case C. The median indices of agreement - taking into account 
the length, content, and order of lists - over all possible physician pairings 
was 0.479, 0.371, 0.509, for Cases A, B, and C, respectively. The median 
agreements between the physicians' lists and the consensus list for each case 
were 0.683, 0.581, and 0.697 (for Cases A, B, and C, respectively).Out of a 
possible 1488 pairings, 2 lists were identical. Physicians most frequently 
ranked problem list items based on their acuity and immediate threat to health.
CONCLUSIONS: The problem list is a physician's mental model of a patient's 
health status. These mental models were found to vary significantly between 
physicians, raising questions about whether problem lists created by individual 
physicians can serve their intended purpose to improve care coordination.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the epidemiology of sarcoidosis from 1946 
through 2013.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An inception cohort of patients with incident sarcoidosis 
from January 1, 1976, through December 31, 2013, in Olmsted County, Minnesota, 
was identified based on comprehensive individual medical record review. 
Inclusion required physician diagnosis supported by histopathologic 
confirmation, radiologic features of intrathoracic sarcoidosis, and a compatible 
clinical presentation. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, 
clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, and mortality. The data were 
augmented with a previously identified cohort of Olmsted County residents 
diagnosed as having sarcoidosis in 1946-1975. Incidence rates were age and sex 
adjusted to the 2010 US white population.
RESULTS: A total of 448 incident cases of sarcoidosis were identified (mean age, 
44.2 years; 52% women). The annual incidence of sarcoidosis was 10.0 per 100,000 
population. The incidence of sarcoidosis increased in women from 1950 to 1960, 
but otherwise there were no significant calendar year trends. However, the peak 
age at incidence for women shifted from 40 to 59 years in 1950 to 50 to 69 years 
in 2010. Similarly, the peak age at incidence for men shifted from 30 to 49 
years in 1950 to 40 to 59 years in 2010. Ninety-seven percent of patients had 
intrathoracic involvement, but only 43% had respiratory symptoms. The overall 
mortality of patients with sarcoidosis was not different from that of the 
general population (standardized mortality ratio=0.90; 95% CI, 0.74-1.08).
CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis occurred in approximately 10 persons per 100,000 per 
year. Most of the patients had intrathoracic involvement, although less than 
half had respiratory symptoms. Overall mortality was not different from that of 
the general population.

The present study analyses the information gain obtained by evaluating adverse 
events during follow-up compared to the sole analysis of events during the 
initial hospital stay for quality measurement purposes. The analysis is based on 
AOK administrative data from the years 2010 to 2012. The analyses were carried 
out for 10 quality indicators from the 4 QSR sectors knee replacement for 
osteoarthritis, appendectomy, prostate surgery for benign prostatic syndrome 
(BPS) and therapeutic cardiac catheterization (PCI) in patients with myocardial 
infarction. A total of 409,774 AOK cases were included. For almost all 
indicators considered, a relevant share of complications can be found to have 
occurred only after discharge from the initial hospitalization (7.7 %-92.6 %). 
Furthermore, there is only a weak connection between the findings from the first 
hospitalization and those from the follow-up period (0.0449 < r < 0.1935). 
26-66 % of the hospitals will be classified differently based on Standardized 
Mortality/Morbidity Ratio (SMR) quartiles if follow-up events are included in 
the quality assessment (with the exception of "Other Complications after PCI" of 
14 %). In summary, quality assessment is improved considerably by evaluating the 
follow-up period for almost all indicators considered. A quality measurement 
based solely on events in the initial hospital stay obscures relevant adverse 
events that have an impact on a comparative hospital quality assessment for 
these indicators.

BACKGROUND: High risk medications are commonly prescribed to older US patients. 
Currently, less is known about high risk medication prescribing in other Western 
Countries, including the UK. We measured trends and correlates of high risk 
medication prescribing in a subset of the older UK population 
(community/institutionalized) to inform harm minimization efforts.
METHODS: Three cross-sectional samples from primary care electronic clinical 
records (UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD) in fiscal years 2003/04, 
2007/08 and 2011/12 were taken. This yielded a sample of 13,900 people aged 
65 years or over from 504 UK general practices. High risk medications were 
defined by 2012 Beers Criteria adapted for the UK. Using descriptive statistical 
methods and regression modelling, prevalence of 'any' (drugs prescribed at least 
once per year) and 'long-term' (drugs prescribed all quarters of year) high risk 
medication prescribing and correlates were determined.
RESULTS: While polypharmacy rates have risen sharply, high risk medication 
prevalence has remained stable across a decade. A third of older (65+) people 
are exposed to high risk medications, but only half of the total prevalence was 
long-term (any = 38.4 % [95 % CI: 36.3, 40.5]; long-term = 17.4 % [15.9, 19.9] 
in 2011/12). Long-term but not any high risk medication exposure was associated 
with older ages (85 years or over). Women and people with higher polypharmacy 
burden were at greater risk of exposure; lower socio-economic status was not 
associated. Ten drugs/drug classes accounted for most of high risk medication 
prescribing in 2011/12.
CONCLUSIONS: High risk medication prescribing has not increased over time 
against a background of increasing polypharmacy in the UK. Half of patients 
receiving high risk medications do so for less than a year. Reducing or 
optimising the use of a limited number of drugs could dramatically reduce high 
risk medications in older people. Further research is needed to investigate why 
the oldest old and women are at greater risk. Interventions to reduce high risk 
medications may need to target shorter and long-term use separately.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the phenotyping performance of three major electronic 
health record (EHR) components: International Classification of Disease (ICD) 
diagnosis codes, primary notes, and specific medications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted the evaluation using de-identified 
Vanderbilt EHR data. We preselected ten diseases: atrial fibrillation, 
Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, gout, human immunodeficiency virus 
infection, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and 
types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. For each disease, patients were classified into 
seven categories based on the presence of evidence in diagnosis codes, primary 
notes, and specific medications. Twenty-five patients per disease category (a 
total number of 175 patients for each disease, 1750 patients for all ten 
diseases) were randomly selected for manual chart review. Review results were 
used to estimate the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, andF-score 
for each EHR component alone and in combination.
RESULTS: The PPVs of single components were inconsistent and inadequate for 
accurately phenotyping (0.06-0.71). Using two or more ICD codes improved the 
average PPV to 0.84. We observed a more stable and higher accuracy when using at 
least two components (mean ± standard deviation: 0.91 ± 0.08). Primary notes 
offered the best sensitivity (0.77). The sensitivity of ICD codes was 0.67. 
Again, two or more components provided a reasonably high and stable sensitivity 
(0.59 ± 0.16). Overall, the best performance (Fscore: 0.70 ± 0.12) was achieved 
by using two or more components. Although the overall performance of using ICD 
codes (0.67 ± 0.14) was only slightly lower than using two or more components, 
its PPV (0.71 ± 0.13) is substantially worse (0.91 ± 0.08).
CONCLUSION: Multiple EHR components provide a more consistent and higher 
performance than a single one for the selected phenotypes. We suggest 
considering multiple EHR components for future phenotyping design in order to 
obtain an ideal result.

BACKGROUND: Case volume per 100 000 population and perioperative mortality rate 
(POMR) are key indicators to monitor and strengthen surgical services. However, 
comparisons of POMR have been restricted by absence of standardised approaches 
to when it is measured, the ideal denominator, need for risk adjustment, and 
whether data are available. We aimed to address these issues and recommend a 
minimum dataset by analysing four large mixed surgical datasets, two from 
well-resourced settings with sophisticated electronic patient information 
systems and two from resource-limited settings where clinicians maintain locally 
developed databases.
METHODS: We obtained data from the New Zealand (NZ) National Minimum Dataset, 
the Geelong Hospital patient management system in Australia, and purpose-built 
surgical databases in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa (PMZ) and Port Moresby, 
Papua New Guinea (PNG). Information was sought on inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, coding criteria, and completeness of patient identifiers, admission, 
procedure, discharge and death dates, operation details, urgency of admission, 
and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. Date-related errors were 
defined as missing dates and impossible discrepancies. For every site, we then 
calculated the POMR, the effect of admission episodes or procedures as 
denominator, and the difference between in-hospital POMR and 30-day POMR. To 
determine the need for risk adjustment, we used univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression to assess the effect on relative POMR for each site of age, 
admission urgency, ASA score, and procedure type.
FINDINGS: 1 365 773 patient admissions involving 1 514 242 procedures were 
included, among which 8655 deaths were recorded within 30 days. Database 
inclusion and exclusion criteria differed substantially. NZ and Geelong records 
had less than 0·1% date-related errors and greater than 99·9% completeness. PMZ 
databases had 99·9% or greater completeness of all data except date-related 
items (94·0%). PNG had 99·9% or greater completeness for date of birth or age 
and admission date and operative procedure, but 80-83% completeness of patient 
identifiers and date related items. Coding of procedures was not standardised, 
and only NZ recorded ASA status and complete post-discharge mortality. 
In-hospital POMR range was 0·38% in NZ to 3·44% in PMZ, and in NZ it 
underestimated 30-day POMR by roughly a third. The difference in POMR by 
procedures instead of admission episodes as denominator ranged from 10% to 70%. 
Age older than 65 years and emergency admission had large independent effects on 
POMR, but relatively little effect in multivariate analysis on the relative odds 
of in-hospital death at each site.
INTERPRETATION: Hospitals can collect and provide data for case volume and POMR 
without sophisticated electronic information systems. POMR should initially be 
defined by in-hospital mortality because post-discharge deaths are not usually 
recorded, and with procedures as denominator because details allowing linkage of 
several operations within one patient's admission are not always present. 
Although age and admission urgency are independently associated with POMR, and 
ASA and case mix were not included, risk adjustment might not be essential 
because the relative odds between sites persisted. Standardisation of inclusion 
criteria and definitions is needed, as is attention to accuracy and completeness 
of dates of procedures, discharge and death. A one-page, paper-based form, or 
alternatively a simple electronic data collection form, containing a minimum 
dataset commenced in the operating theatre could facilitate this process.
FUNDING: None.

Problem oriented medical record (POMR) was born in late sixties. Expecting an 
ordered, complete and updated medical record were some of the goals of its 
founder. Several healthcare institutions have included problem list into their 
clinical records but some concerns have been reported. These concerns are in 
reference to their voluminosity, incompleteness and outdatedness. This study 
attempts to understand how healthcare professionals are using the problem list 
at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA). We believe it is essential to 
understand the local reality applied to our own applications and cultural 
instances of documentation. This report is the basis from which several 
improvements could be made in order to meet the goals of Weed's proposal.

(1)Department of Health Informatics, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, Brazil.

The use of Electronic Dental Records (EDRs) and management software has become 
more frequent, following the increase in prevelance of new technologies and 
computers in dental offices. The purpose of this study is to identify and 
evaluate the use of EDRs by the dental community in the São Paulo city area. A 
quantitative case study was performed using a survey on the phone. A total of 54 
offices were contacted and only one declinedparticipation in this study. Only 
one office did not have a computer. EDRs were used in 28 offices and only four 
were paperless. The lack of studies in this area suggests the need for more 
usability and implementation studies on EDRs so that we can improve EDR adoption 
by the dental community.

An algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy in diabetes in computerised problem 
orientated medical records (POMR) compared with an established algorithm 
developed in episode orientated records (EOMR).

BACKGROUND: An algorithm that detects errors in diagnosis, classification or 
coding of diabetes in primary care computerised medial record (CMR) systems is 
currently available. However, this was developed on CMR systems that are episode 
orientated medical records (EOMR); and do not force the user to always code a 
problem or link data to an existing one. More strictly problem orientated 
medical record (POMR) systems mandate recording a problem and linking 
consultation data to them.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of detection of diagnostic accuracy using an 
algorithm developed in EOMR with a new POMR specific algorithm.
METHOD: We used data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (N = 
2,466,364) to identify a population of 100,513 (4.08%) patients considered 
likely to have diabetes. We recalibrated algorithms designed to classify cases 
of diabetes to take account of that POMR enforced coding consistency in the 
computerised medical record systems [In Practice Systems (InPS) Vision] that 
contribute data to THIN. We explored the different proportions of people 
classified as having type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) and with diabetes unclassifiable as either T1DM or T2DM. We compared 
proportions using chi-square tests and used Tukey's test to compare the 
characteristics of the people in each group.
RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM using the original EOMR algorithm was 0.38% 
(9,264/2,466,364), and for T2DM 3.22% (79,417/2,466,364). The prevalence using 
the new POMR algorithm was 0.31% (7,750/2,466,364) T1DM and 3.65% 
(89,990/2,466,364) T2DM. The EOMR algorithms also left more people unclassified 
11,439 (12%), as to their type of diabetes compared with 2,380 (2.4%), for the 
new algorithm. Those people who were only classified by the EOMR system differed 
in terms of older age, and apparently better glycaemic control, despite not 
being prescribed medication for their diabetes (p < 0.005).
CONCLUSION: Increasing the degree of problem orientation of the medical record 
system can improve the accuracy of recording of diagnoses and, therefore, the 
accuracy of using routinely collected data from CMRs to determine the prevalence 
of diabetes mellitus; data processing strategies should reflect the degree of 
problem orientation.

OBJECTIVE: To assess problem list completeness using an objective measure across 
a range of sites, and to identify success factors for problem list completeness.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data 
and interviews at ten healthcare organizations within the United States, United 
Kingdom, and Argentina who use a variety of electronic health record systems: 
four self-developed and six commercial. At each site, we assessed the proportion 
of patients who have diabetes recorded on their problem list out of all patients 
with a hemoglobin A1c elevation>=7.0%, which is diagnostic of diabetes. We then 
conducted interviews with informatics leaders at the four highest performing 
sites to determine factors associated with success. Finally, we surveyed all the 
sites about common practices implemented at the top performing sites to 
determine whether there was an association between problem list management 
practices and problem list completeness.
RESULTS: Problem list completeness across the ten sites ranged from 60.2% to 
99.4%, with a mean of 78.2%. Financial incentives, problem-oriented charting, 
gap reporting, shared responsibility, links to billing codes, and organizational 
culture were identified as success factors at the four hospitals with problem 
list completeness at or near 90.0%.
DISCUSSION: Incomplete problem lists represent a global data integrity problem 
that could compromise quality of care and put patients at risk. There was a wide 
range of problem list completeness across the healthcare facilities. 
Nevertheless, some facilities have achieved high levels of problem list 
completeness, and it is important to better understand the factors that 
contribute to success to improve patient safety.
CONCLUSION: Problem list completeness varies substantially across healthcare 
facilities. In our review of EHR systems at ten healthcare facilities, we 
identified six success factors which may be useful for healthcare organizations 
seeking to improve the quality of their problem list documentation: financial 
incentives, problem oriented charting, gap reporting, shared responsibility, 
links to billing codes, and organizational culture.

INTRODUCTION: The follow-up for head and neck cancer (HNC) focussed on therapy 
control. Accessory long term functionality is important. Impairment of function 
is observed, but a comparable documentation is not established. Additional we 
frequently see psychooncological comorbidities, what complicates the assessment. 
This was the reason why Tschiesner et al. developed on the base of the "ICF Core 
set for head and neck cancer" a guideline for the Assessment of Function in HNC. 
In consequence of good results in other tumour entities we developed an 
electronic version (OncoFunction).
METHODS: In a proof of concept study all patients of our follow up consultation 
from 07/13 to 03/14 were included. OncoFunction was given to patients in a 
digital form using tablet computers. The results were visible to the physician 
in a concentrated form before consultation and were supplemented by a physician 
questionnaire. Furthermore we evaluated the usability in 202 patients.
RESULTS: We had 682 patient contacts. 530 patient contacts (77, 7%) used the 
questionnaire. The physician questionnaire was answered in 470 times. Finally 
there are from 69.8% of the patient contacts full datasets available. Between 
users and non-users of the questionnaire we see no difference.
CONCLUSION: The use of a computer-based screening and feedback system 
(OncoFunction) in clinical use is feasible and excellent assessed by patients. 
The patient data are visible in a compact form for the physician and problems 
can clear addressed to the patient. One more benefit is the standardized follow 
up documentation and the use of comparable data in research.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have shown 
that routine clinical data in HIV clinics often have errors. Lack of structured 
and coded documentation of diagnosis of AIDS defining illnesses (ADIs) can 
compromise data quality and decisions made on clinical care.
METHODS: We used a structured framework to derive a reference set of concepts 
and terms used to describe ADIs. The four sources used were: (i) CDC/Accenture 
list of opportunistic infections, (ii) SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), (iii) 
Focus Group Discussion (FGD) among clinicians and nurses attending to patients 
at a referral provincial hospital in western Kenya, and (iv) chart abstraction 
from the Maternal Child Health (MCH) and HIV clinics at the same hospital. Using 
the January 2014 release of SNOMED CT, concepts were retrieved that matched 
terms abstracted from approach iii & iv, and the content coverage assessed. 
Post-coordination matching was applied when needed.
RESULTS: The final reference set had 1054 unique ADI concepts which were 
described by 1860 unique terms. Content coverage of SNOMED CT was high (99.9% 
with pre-coordinated concepts; 100% with post-coordination). The resulting 
reference set for ADIs was implemented as the interface terminology on OpenMRS 
data entry forms.
CONCLUSION: Different sources demonstrate complementarity in the collection of 
concepts and terms for an interface terminology. SNOMED CT provides a high 
coverage in the domain of ADIs. Further work is needed to evaluate the effect of 
the interface terminology on data quality and quality of care.

BACKGROUND: Clinical knowledge bases of problem-medication pairs are necessary 
for many informatics solutions that improve patient safety, such as clinical 
summarization. However, developing these knowledge bases can be challenging.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate a previously developed crowdsourcing approach 
for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs in a large, 
non-university health care system with a widely used, commercially available 
electronic health record.
METHODS: We first retrieved medications and problems entered in the electronic 
health record by clinicians during routine care during a six month study period. 
Following the previously published approach, we calculated the link frequency 
and link ratio for each pair then identified a threshold cutoff for estimated 
problem-medication pair appropriateness through clinician review; 
problem-medication pairs meeting the threshold were included in the resulting 
knowledge base. We selected 50 medications and their gold standard indications 
to compare the resulting knowledge base to the pilot knowledge base developed 
previously and determine its recall and precision.
RESULTS: The resulting knowledge base contained 26,912 pairs, had a recall of 
62.3% and a precision of 87.5%, and outperformed the pilot knowledge base 
containing 11,167 pairs from the previous study, which had a recall of 46.9% and 
a precision of 83.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: We validated the crowdsourcing approach for generating a knowledge 
base of problem-medication pairs in a large non-university health care system 
with a widely used, commercially available electronic health record, indicating 
that the approach may be generalizable across healthcare settings and clinical 
systems. Further research is necessary to better evaluate the knowledge, to 
compare crowdsourcing with other approaches, and to evaluate if incorporating 
the knowledge into electronic health records improves patient outcomes.

Increased survival of patients with childhood cancer has resulted in a growing 
population of survivors. In France approximately 50,000 alive people have been 
treated before 20 years old and, as survivors, are at risk for health problems 
due to disease or cancer therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy). 
Complications such as cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease (after 
radiotherapy or chemotherapy), neurocognitive deficiency, endocrine disorders 
(hypopituitary axis, or thyroid dysfunction), gonadal function, and second 
malignancy can be life-threatening and seriously affect quality of life. Upon 
discharge former patients should be given 'passport', containing a summary of 
their medical history, treatment (surgery, chemotherapy cumulative doses, 
characteristics of radiotherapy and organs involved), methods used to preserve 
fertility, and complications during treatment. Treatments can then be linked to 
individualized recommendations for follow-up care. The risk of developing 
long-term complications increases with time and can be aggravated by age-related 
comorbidity and environmental factors (tobacco, alcohol, obesity). Many regions 
and treatment centres in France have in place organised long-term follow-up 
procedures.

OBJECTIVE: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is 
the emergent international health terminology standard for encoding clinical 
information in electronic health records. The CORE Problem List Subset was 
created to facilitate the terminology's implementation. This study evaluates the 
CORE Subset's coverage and examines its growth pattern as source datasets are 
being incorporated.
METHODS: Coverage of frequently used terms and the corresponding usage of the 
covered terms were assessed by "leave-one-out" analysis of the eight datasets 
constituting the current CORE Subset. The growth pattern was studied using a 
retrospective experiment, growing the Subset one dataset at a time and examining 
the relationship between the size of the starting subset and the coverage of 
frequently used terms in the incoming dataset. Linear regression was used to 
model that relationship.
RESULTS: On average, the CORE Subset covered 80.3% of the frequently used terms 
of the left-out dataset, and the covered terms accounted for 83.7% of term 
usage. There was a significant positive correlation between the CORE Subset's 
size and the coverage of the frequently used terms in an incoming dataset. This 
implies that the CORE Subset will grow at a progressively slower pace as it gets 
bigger.
CONCLUSION: The CORE Problem List Subset is a useful resource for the 
implementation of Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms in 
electronic health records. It offers good coverage of frequently used terms, 
which account for a high proportion of term usage. If future datasets are 
incorporated into the CORE Subset, it is likely that its size will remain small 
and manageable.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the opinions, emotions, and actions taken by patients 
who viewed their electronic problem list via an online personal health record 
(PHR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey of patients who viewed their problem 
lists, as maintained by their healthcare provider, in a web-based PHR linked to 
an electronic health record for the first time.
RESULTS: A total 3,649 patients completed the survey, yielding a response rate 
of 42.1%. Patient attitudes towards the problem list function were positive 
overall, with 90.4% rating it at least somewhat useful and 86.7% reporting they 
would probably or definitely use it again. Nearly half (45.6%) of patients 
identified at least one major or minor problem missing from their list. After 
viewing the list, 56.1% of patients reported taking at least one action in 
response, with 32.4% of patients reporting that they researched a condition on 
the Internet, 18.3% reported that they contacted their healthcare provider and 
16.7% reported changing or planning to change a health behavior (patients could 
report multiple actions). 64.7% of patients reported feeling at least somewhat 
happy while viewing their problem list, though others reported feeling sad 
(30.4%), worried (35.7%) or scared (23.8%) (patients could report multiple 
emotions). A smaller number of patients reported feeling angry (16.6%) or 
ashamed (14.3%). Patients who experienced an emotional response were more likely 
to take action.
CONCLUSION: Overall, patients found the ability to view their problem lists very 
useful and took action in response to the information. However, some had 
negative emotions. More research is needed into optimal strategies for 
supporting patients receiving this information.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent in patients with heart 
failure and is associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether specific 
cognitive abilities (eg, memory vs executive function) are impaired in heart 
failure has not been fully examined. We investigated the prevalence of 
impairment in 3 cognitive domains in patients hospitalized with acute 
decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and the associations of impairment with 
demographic and clinical characteristics.
METHODS: The sample included 744 patients hospitalized with ADHF (mean age 72 
years, 46% female) at 5 medical centers. Impairment was assessed in 3 cognitive 
domains (memory, processing speed, executive function) using standardized 
measures. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from a 
structured interview and medical record review.
RESULTS: A total of 593 (80%) of 744 patients were impaired in at least 1 
cognitive domain; 32%, 31%, and 17% of patients were impaired in 1, 2, or all 3 
cognitive domains, respectively. Patients impaired in more than 1 cognitive 
domain were significantly older, had less formal education, and had more 
noncardiac comorbidities (all P values < .05). In multivariable adjusted 
analyses, patients with older age and lower education had higher odds of 
impairment in 2 or more cognitive domains. Depressed patients had twice the odds 
of being impaired in all 3 cognitive domains (odds ratio 1.98, 95% CI 
1.08-3.64).
CONCLUSION: Impairments in executive function, processing speed, and memory are 
common among patients hospitalized for ADHF. Recognition of these prevalent 
cognitive deficits is critical for the clinical management of these high-risk 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Errors related to medication seriously affect patient safety and the 
quality of healthcare. It has been widely argued that various types of such 
errors may be prevented by introducing Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) 
at the point of care.
OBJECTIVES: Although significant research has been conducted in the field, still 
medication safety is a crucial issue, while few research outcomes are mature 
enough to be considered for use in actual clinical settings. In this paper, we 
present a clinical decision support framework targeting medication safety with 
major focus on adverse drug event (ADE) prevention.
METHODS: The novelty of the framework lies in its design that approaches the 
problem holistically, i.e., starting from knowledge discovery to provide 
reliable numbers about ADEs per hospital or medical unit to describe their 
consequences and probable causes, and next employing the acquired knowledge for 
decision support services development and deployment. Major design features of 
the framework's services are: a) their adaptation to the context of care (i.e. 
patient characteristics, place of care, and significance of ADEs), and b) their 
straightforward integration in the healthcare information technologies (IT) 
infrastructure thanks to the adoption of a service-oriented architecture (SOA) 
and relevant standards.
RESULTS: Our results illustrate the successful interoperability of the framework 
with two commercially available IT products, i.e., a Computerized Physician 
Order Entry (CPOE) and an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, respectively, 
along with a Web prototype that is independent of existing healthcare IT 
products. The conducted clinical validation with domain experts and test cases 
illustrates that the impact of the framework is expected to be major, with 
respect to patient safety, and towards introducing the CDSS functionality in 
practical use.
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates an important potential for the applicability 
of the presented framework in delivering contextualized decision support 
services at the point of care and for making a substantial contribution towards 
ADE prevention. Nonetheless, further research is required in order to 
quantitatively and thoroughly assess its impact in medication safety.

BACKGROUND: The problem list is a meaningful use incentivized criterion, and 
>80% of patients should have 1 problem entered as structured data.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to use a series of interventions to 
increase the use of the problem list for inpatients to >80% as measured by at 
least 1 hospital problem at discharge.
METHODS: This study was a quasi-experimental time series quality improvement 
trial. The primary outcome was 80% of medical and psychiatric inpatients with a 
problem added to the problem list before discharge. Control charts of percentage 
(p charts) of medical and psychiatric patients with an inpatient problem list at 
discharge were constructed with three-σ control limits. Control limits were 
revised after evidence of improvement. The charts were annotated with 
interventions, including increasing awareness, focused education, and timely 
feedback in the form of performance graphs e-mailed to providers.
RESULTS: For medical inpatients, use rose from 31% to 97% at its peak in April 
2011 and continues to maintain above the goal of 80%. In psychiatry, problem 
list use rose from 2% initially to an average of 72% after the interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains were made with inpatient problem list usage by 
the medical and psychiatric teams. Our goal ascribed by meaningful use for >80% 
of inpatients to have a problem at discharge was met after initiation of our 
series of interventions.

Larry Weed, MD is widely known as the father of the problem-oriented medical 
record and inventor of the now-ubiquitous SOAP 
(subjective/objective/assessment/plan) note, for developing an electronic health 
record system (Problem-Oriented Medical Information System, PROMIS), and for 
founding a company (since acquired), which developed problem-knowledge couplers. 
However, Dr Weed's vision for medicine goes far beyond software--over the course 
of his storied career, he has relentlessly sought to bring the scientific method 
to medical practice and, where necessary, to point out shortcomings in the 
system and advocate for change. In this oral history, Dr Weed describes, in his 
own words, the arcs of his long career and the work that remains to be done.

The National Library of Medicine has published the CORE and the VA/KP problem 
lists to facilitate the usage of SNOMED CT for encoding diagnoses and clinical 
data of patients in electronic health records. Therefore, it is essential for 
the content of the problem lists to be as accurate and consistent as possible. 
This study assesses the effectiveness of using a concept's word length and 
number of parents, two structural indicators for measuring concept complexity, 
to identify inconsistencies with high probability. The method is able to isolate 
concepts with over 40% expected of being erroneous. A structural indicator for 
concepts which is able to identify 52% of the examined concepts as having errors 
in synonyms is also presented. The results demonstrate that the concepts in 
problem lists are not free of inconsistencies and further quality assurance is 
needed to improve the quality of these concepts.

The patient problem list, like administrative claims data, has become an 
important source of data for decision support, patient cohort identification, 
and alerting systems. A two-fold intervention to increase capture of problems on 
the problem list automatically - with minimal disruption to admitting and 
provider billing workflows - is described. For new patients with no prior data 
in the electronic health record, the intervention resulted in a statistically 
significant increase in the number of problems recorded to the problem list (3.8 
vs 2.9 problems post-and pre-intervention respectively, p value 2×10(-16)). The 
majority of problems were recorded in the first 24 hours of admission. The 
proportion of patients with at least one problem coded to the problem list 
within the first 24 hours increased from 94% to 98% before and after 
intervention (chi square 344, p value 2×10(-16)). ICD9 "V codes" connoting 
circumstances beyond disease were captured at a higher rate post intervention 
than before. Deyo/Charlson comorbidities derived from problem list data were 
more similar to those derived from claims data after the intervention than 
before (Jaccard similarity 0.3 post- vs 0.21 pre-intervention, p value 
2×10(-16)). A workflow-sensitive, non-interruptive means of capturing 
provider-entered codes early in admission can improve both the quantity and 
content of problems on the patient problem list.

Electronic problem lists are essential to modern health record systems, with a 
primary goal to serve as the repository of a patient's current health issues. 
Additionally, coded problems can be used to drive downstream activities such as 
decision support, evidence-based medicine, billing, and cohort generation for 
research. Meaningful Use also requires use of a coded problem list. Over the 
course of three years, Intermountain Healthcare developed a problem management 
module (PMM) that provided innovative functionality to improve clinical workflow 
and boost problem list adoption, e.g. smart search, user customizable views, 
problem evolution, and problem timelines. In 23 months of clinical use, 
clinicians entered over 70,000 health issues, the percentage of free-text items 
dropped to 1.2%, completeness of problem list items increased by 14%, and more 
collaborative habits were initiated.

BACKGROUND: Correlation of data within electronic health records is necessary 
for implementation of various clinical decision support functions, including 
patient summarization. A key type of correlation is linking medications to 
clinical problems; while some databases of problem-medication links are 
available, they are not robust and depend on problems and medications being 
encoded in particular terminologies. Crowdsourcing represents one approach to 
generating robust knowledge bases across a variety of terminologies, but more 
sophisticated approaches are necessary to improve accuracy and reduce manual 
data review requirements.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and evaluate a clinician reputation metric to 
facilitate the identification of appropriate problem-medication pairs through 
crowdsourcing without requiring extensive manual review.
APPROACH: We retrieved medications from our clinical data warehouse that had 
been prescribed and manually linked to one or more problems by clinicians during 
e-prescribing between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2011. We identified measures 
likely to be associated with the percentage of accurate problem-medication links 
made by clinicians. Using logistic regression, we created a metric for 
identifying clinicians who had made greater than or equal to 95% appropriate 
links. We evaluated the accuracy of the approach by comparing links made by 
those physicians identified as having appropriate links to a previously manually 
validated subset of problem-medication pairs.
RESULTS: Of 867 clinicians who asserted a total of 237,748 problem-medication 
links during the study period, 125 had a reputation metric that predicted the 
percentage of appropriate links greater than or equal to 95%. These clinicians 
asserted a total of 2464 linked problem-medication pairs (983 distinct pairs). 
Compared to a previously validated set of problem-medication pairs, the 
reputation metric achieved a specificity of 99.5% and marginally improved the 
sensitivity of previously described knowledge bases.
CONCLUSION: A reputation metric may be a valuable measure for identifying high 
quality clinician-entered, crowdsourced data.

Adding obesity to the problem list increases the rate of providers addressing 
obesity.

Banerjee ES(1), Gambler A, Fogleman C.

Author information:
(1)Thomas Jefferson University.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a common problem that increases risk of 
many other diseases, from heart disease to cancer. While counseling by a 
physician increases patient report of weight loss attempts and increased 
exercise, primary care physicians do not frequently address obesity. The 
objectives of this study were to determine how often obesity was included on the 
problem list and whether adding obesity to the problem list affected the rate at 
which it was addressed in future visits.
METHODS: We conducted an initial assessment, followed by a randomized controlled 
trial of patient records at a family medicine residency office. The intervention 
was the addition of obesity to the problem list. The measured outcome was 
whether or not obesity was listed as an encounter diagnosis in the following 5 
months.
RESULTS: At baseline, 36.2% of obese patients had obesity on their problem list. 
A total of 55.5% of these patients had obesity addressed by a provider in the 
past year, compared with 5.1% of patients who did not have obesity on their 
problem list. In the 5 months following the intervention, 38 (14.7%) of the 258 
patients in the intervention group had obesity addressed, compared with 11 
(4.6%) of the 239 patients in the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant relationship between the addition of obesity 
to the problem list and providers addressing obesity at future visits. This 
simple intervention could be accomplished automatically by the EMR and has the 
potential to change provider behavior.

The EHR-ARCHE project: satisfying clinical information needs in a Shared 
Electronic Health Record system based on IHE XDS and Archetypes.

PURPOSE: While contributing to an improved continuity of care, Shared Electronic 
Health Record (EHR) systems may also lead to information overload of healthcare 
providers. Document-oriented architectures, such as the commonly employed IHE 
XDS profile, which only support information retrieval at the level of documents, 
are particularly susceptible for this problem. The objective of the EHR-ARCHE 
project was to develop a methodology and a prototype to efficiently satisfy 
healthcare providers' information needs when accessing a patient's Shared EHR 
during a treatment situation. We especially aimed to investigate whether this 
objective can be reached by integrating EHR Archetypes into an IHE XDS 
environment.
METHODS: Using methodical triangulation, we first analysed the information needs 
of healthcare providers, focusing on the treatment of diabetes patients as an 
exemplary application domain. We then designed ISO/EN 13606 Archetypes covering 
the identified information needs. To support a content-based search for 
fine-grained information items within EHR documents, we extended the IHE XDS 
environment with two additional actors. Finally, we conducted a formative and 
summative evaluation of our approach within a controlled study.
RESULTS: We identified 446 frequently needed diabetes-specific information 
items, representing typical information needs of healthcare providers. We then 
created 128 Archetypes and 120 EHR documents for two fictive patients. All seven 
diabetes experts, who evaluated our approach, preferred the content-based search 
to a conventional XDS search. Success rates of finding relevant information was 
higher for the content-based search (100% versus 80%) and the latter was also 
more time-efficient (8-14min versus 20min or more).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that for an efficient satisfaction of health care 
providers' information needs, a content-based search that rests upon the 
integration of Archetypes into an IHE XDS-based Shared EHR system is superior to 
a conventional metadata-based XDS search.

Physicians do not always keep the problem list accurate, complete and updated.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze natural language processing (NLP) techniques and inference 
rules as strategies to maintain completeness and accuracy of the problem list in 
EHRs.
METHODS: Non systematic literature review in PubMed, in the last 10 years. 
Strategies to maintain the EHRs problem list were analyzed in two ways: 
inputting and removing problems from the problem list.
RESULTS: NLP and inference rules have acceptable performance for inputting 
problems into the problem list. No studies using these techniques for removing 
problems were published Conclusion: Both tools, NLP and inference rules have had 
acceptable results as tools for maintain the completeness and accuracy of the 
problem list.

Sciences, Kagoshima University.

In Japan, POS (problem oriented system) is recommended in the clinical 
guideline. Therefore, the records are mainly made by SOAP. We developed a system 
mainly with a function which enabled our staff members of all kinds of 
professions including doctors to enter the patients' clinical information as an 
identical record, regardless if they were outpatients or inpatients, and to 
observe the contents chronologically. This electric patient record system is 
called "e-kanja recording system". On this system, all staff members in the 
medical team can now share the same information. Moreover, the contents can be 
reviewed by colleagues; the quality of records has been improved as it is 
evaluated by the others.

INTRODUCTION: Social networks applied through Web 2.0 tools have gained 
importance in health domain, because they produce improvements on the 
communication and coordination capabilities among health professionals. This is 
highly relevant for multimorbidity patients care because there is a large number 
of health professionals in charge of patient care, and this requires to obtain 
clinical consensus in their decisions. Our objective is to develop a tool for 
collaborative work among health professionals for multimorbidity patient care. 
We describe the architecture to incorporate decision support functionalities in 
a social network tool to enable the adoption of shared decisions among health 
professionals from different care levels. As part of the first stage of the 
project, this paper describes the results obtained in a pilot study about 
acceptance and use of the social network component in our healthcare setting.
METHODS: At Virgen del Rocío University Hospital we have designed and developed 
the Shared Care Platform (SCP) to provide support in the continuity of care for 
multimorbidity patients. The SCP has two consecutively developed components: 
social network component, called Clinical Wall, and Clinical Decision Support 
(CDS) system. The Clinical Wall contains a record where health professionals are 
able to debate and define shared decisions. We conducted a pilot study to assess 
the use and acceptance of the SCP by healthcare professionals through 
questionnaire based on the theory of the Technology Acceptance Model.
RESULTS: In March 2012 we released and deployed the SCP, but only with the 
social network component. The pilot project lasted 6 months in the hospital and 
2 primary care centers. From March to September 2012 we created 16 records in 
the Clinical Wall, all with a high priority. A total of 10 professionals took 
part in the exchange of messages: 3 internists and 7 general practitioners 
generated 33 messages. 12 of the 16 record (75%) were answered by the 
destination health professionals. The professionals valued positively all the 
items in the questionnaire. As part of the SCP, opensource tools for CDS will be 
incorporated to provide recommendations for medication and problem interactions, 
as well as to calculate indexes or scales from validated questionnaires. They 
will receive the patient summary information provided by the regional Electronic 
Health Record system through a web service with the information defined 
according to the virtual Medical Record specification.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical Wall has been developed to allow communication and 
coordination between the healthcare professionals involved in multimorbidity 
patient care. Agreed decisions were about coordination for appointment changing, 
patient conditions, diagnosis tests, and prescription changes and renewal. The 
application of interoperability standards and open source software can bridge 
the gap between knowledge and clinical practice, while enabling interoperability 
and scalability. Open source with the social network encourages adoption and 
facilitates collaboration. Although the results obtained for use indicators are 
still not as high as it was expected, based on the promising results obtained in 
the acceptance questionnaire of SMP, we expect that the new CDS tools will 
increase the use by the health professionals.

RESEARCH PROBLEM: Tutorials and user manuals are important forms of impersonal 
support for using software applications including electronic medical records 
(EMRs). Differences between user- and vendor documentation may indicate support 
needs, which are not sufficiently addressed by the official documentation, and 
reveal new elements that may inform the design of tutorials and user manuals.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the differences between user-generated tutorials and 
manuals for an EMR and the official user manual from the software vendor?
LITERATURE REVIEW: Effective design of tutorials and user manuals requires 
careful packaging of information, balance between declarative and procedural 
texts, an action and task-oriented approach, support for error recognition and 
recovery, and effective use of visual elements. No previous research compared 
these elements between formal and informal documents.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted an mixed methods study. Seven tutorials and two 
manuals for an EMR were collected from three family health teams and compared 
with the official user manual from the software vendor. Documents were 
qualitatively analyzed using a framework analysis approach in relation to the 
principles of technical documentation described above. Subsets of the data were 
quantitatively analyzed using cross-tabulation to compare the types of error 
information and visual cues in screen captures between user- and 
vendor-generated manuals.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The user-developed tutorials and manuals differed from 
the vendor-developed manual in that they contained mostly procedural and not 
declarative information; were customized to the specific workflow, user roles, 
and patient characteristics; contained more error information related to work 
processes than to software usage; and used explicit visual cues on screen 
captures to help users identify window elements. These findings imply that to 
support EMR implementation, tutorials and manuals need to be customized and 
adapted to specific organizational contexts and workflows. The main limitation 
of the study is its generalizability. Future research should address this 
limitation and may explore alternative approaches to software documentation, 
such as modular manuals or participatory design.

Health care transformation through collaboration on open-source informatics 
projects: integrating a medical applications platform, research data repository, 
and patient summarization.

BACKGROUND: The Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) program 
seeks to conquer well-understood challenges in medical informatics through 
breakthrough research. Two SHARP centers have found alignment in their 
methodological needs: (1) members of the National Center for Cognitive 
Informatics and Decision-making (NCCD) have developed knowledge bases to support 
problem-oriented summarizations of patient data, and (2) Substitutable Medical 
Apps, Reusable Technologies (SMART), which is a platform for reusable medical 
apps that can run on participating platforms connected to various electronic 
health records (EHR). Combining the work of these two centers will ensure wide 
dissemination of new methods for synthesized views of patient data. Informatics 
for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is an NIH-funded clinical 
research data repository platform in use at over 100 sites worldwide. By also 
working with a co-occurring initiative to SMART-enabling i2b2, we can 
confidently write one app that can be used extremely broadly.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to facilitate development of intuitive, problem-oriented 
views of the patient record using NCCD knowledge bases that would run in any 
EHR. To do this, we developed a collaboration between the two SHARPs and an NIH 
center, i2b2.
METHODS: First, we implemented collaborative tools to connect researchers at 
three institutions. Next, we developed a patient summarization app using the 
SMART platform and a previously validated NCCD problem-medication linkage 
knowledge base derived from the National Drug File-Reference Terminology 
(NDF-RT). Finally, to SMART-enable i2b2, we implemented two new Web service 
"cells" that expose the SMART application programming interface (API), and we 
made changes to the Web interface of i2b2 to host a "carousel" of SMART apps.
RESULTS: We deployed our SMART-based, NDF-RT-derived patient summarization app 
in this SMART-i2b2 container. It displays a problem-oriented view of medications 
and presents a line-graph display of laboratory results.
CONCLUSIONS: This summarization app can be run in any EHR environment that 
either supports SMART or runs SMART-enabled i2b2. This i2b2 "clinical bridge" 
demonstrates a pathway for reusable app development that does not require EHR 
vendors to immediately adopt the SMART API. Apps can be developed in SMART and 
run by clinicians in the i2b2 repository, reusing clinical data extracted from 
EHRs. This may encourage the adoption of SMART by supporting SMART app 
development until EHRs adopt the platform. It also allows a new variety of 
clinical SMART apps, fueled by the broad aggregation of data types available in 
research repositories. The app (including its knowledge base) and SMART-i2b2 are 
open-source and freely available for download.

Interoperability of clinical decision-support systems and electronic health 
records using archetypes: a case study in clinical trial eligibility.

Clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) comprise systems as diverse as 
sophisticated platforms to store and manage clinical data, tools to alert 
clinicians of problematic situations, or decision-making tools to assist 
clinicians. Irrespective of the kind of decision-support task CDSSs should be 
smoothly integrated within the clinical information system, interacting with 
other components, in particular with the electronic health record (EHR). 
However, despite decades of developments, most CDSSs lack interoperability 
features. We deal with the interoperability problem of CDSSs and EHRs by 
exploiting the dual-model methodology. This methodology distinguishes a 
reference model and archetypes. A reference model is represented by a stable and 
small object-oriented model that describes the generic properties of health 
record information. For their part, archetypes are reusable and domain-specific 
definitions of clinical concepts in the form of structured and constrained 
combinations of the entities of the reference model. We rely on archetypes to 
make the CDSS compatible with EHRs from different institutions. Concretely, we 
use archetypes for modelling the clinical concepts that the CDSS requires, in 
conjunction with a series of knowledge-intensive mappings relating the 
archetypes to the data sources (EHR and/or other archetypes) they depend on. We 
introduce a comprehensive approach, including a set of tools as well as 
methodological guidelines, to deal with the interoperability of CDSSs and EHRs 
based on archetypes. Archetypes are used to build a conceptual layer of the kind 
of a virtual health record (VHR) over the EHR whose contents need to be 
integrated and used in the CDSS, associating them with structural and 
terminology-based semantics. Subsequently, the archetypes are mapped to the EHR 
by means of an expressive mapping language and specific-purpose tools. We also 
describe a case study where the tools and methodology have been employed in a 
CDSS to support patient recruitment in the framework of a clinical trial for 
colorectal cancer screening. The utilisation of archetypes not only has proved 
satisfactory to achieve interoperability between CDSSs and EHRs but also offers 
various advantages, in particular from a data model perspective. First, the 
VHR/data models we work with are of a high level of abstraction and can 
incorporate semantic descriptions. Second, archetypes can potentially deal with 
different EHR architectures, due to their deliberate independence of the 
reference model. Third, the archetype instances we obtain are valid instances of 
the underlying reference model, which would enable e.g. feeding back the EHR 
with data derived by abstraction mechanisms. Lastly, the medical and technical 
validity of archetype models would be assured, since in principle clinicians 
should be the main actors in their development.

OBJECTIVE: By 2015, SNOMED CT (SCT) will become the USA's standard for encoding 
diagnoses and problem lists in electronic health records (EHRs). To facilitate 
this effort, the National Library of Medicine has published the "SCT Clinical 
Observations Recording and Encoding" and the "Veterans Health Administration and 
Kaiser Permanente" problem lists (collectively, the "PL"). The PL is studied in 
regard to its readiness to support meaningful use of EHRs. In particular, we 
wish to determine if inconsistencies appearing in SCT, in general, occur as 
frequently in the PL, and whether further quality-assurance (QA) efforts on the 
PL are required.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study is conducted where two random samples of SCT 
concepts are compared. The first consists of concepts strictly from the PL and 
the second contains general SCT concepts distributed proportionally to the PL's 
in terms of their hierarchies. Each sample is analyzed for its percentage of 
primitive concepts and for frequency of modeling errors of various severity 
levels as quality measures. A simple structural indicator, namely, the number of 
parents, is suggested to locate high likelihood inconsistencies in hierarchical 
relationships. The effectiveness of this indicator is evaluated.
RESULTS: PL concepts are found to be slightly better than other concepts in the 
respective SCT hierarchies with regards to the quality measure of the percentage 
of primitive concepts and the frequency of modeling errors. There were 58% 
primitive concepts in the PL sample versus 62% in the control sample. The 
structural indicator of number of parents is shown to be statistically 
significant in its ability to identify concepts having a higher likelihood of 
inconsistencies in their hierarchical relationships. The absolute number of 
errors in the group of concepts having 1-3 parents was shown to be significantly 
lower than that for concepts with 4-6 parents and those with 7 or more parents 
based on Chi-squared analyses.
CONCLUSION: PL concepts suffer from the same issues as general SCT concepts, 
although to a slightly lesser extent, and do require further QA efforts to 
promote meaningful use of EHRs. To support such efforts, a structural indicator 
is shown to effectively ferret out potentially problematic concepts where those 
QA efforts should be focused.

Data sources for heart failure comparative effectiveness research.

NC 27715, USA.

Existing data sources for heart failure research offer advantages and 
disadvantages for CER. Clinical registries collect detailed information about 
disease presentation, treatment, and outcomes on a large number of patients and 
provide the "real-world" population that is the hallmark of CER. Data are not 
collected longitudinally, however, and follow-up is often limited. Large 
administrative datasets provide the broadest population coverage with 
longitudinal outcomes follow-up but lack clinical detail. Linking clinical 
registries with other databases to assess longitudinal outcomes holds great 
promise. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research 
recommends further efforts on longitudinal linking of administrative or 
EHR-based databases, patient registries, private sector databases (particularly 
those with commercially insured populations that are not covered under federal 
and state databases), and other relevant data sources containing pharmacy, 
laboratory, adverse events, and mortality information. Advancing the 
infrastructure to provide robust, scientific data resources for patient-centered 
CER must remain a priority.

Modeling problem-oriented clinical notes.

Nijmegen, The Netherlands. F.Cillessen@mi.umcn.nl

OBJECTIVES: To develop a model as a starting-point for developing a 
problem-oriented clinical notes application as a generic component of an 
Electronic Health Record (EHR).
METHODS: We used the generic conceptualization of Weed's problem-oriented 
medical record (POMR) to link progress notes to problems, and the Subjective, 
Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP) headings to classify elements of these notes. 
Health Level 7 (HL7) Version 3 and Unified Modeling Language (UML) were used for 
modeling. We looked especially at the role of Conditions and Concerns, and how 
to model these to document clinical reasoning.
RESULTS: We developed a generic HL7-based model for progress notes. In this 
model the specific clinical note has a condition as its reason. An assertion can 
be made about a condition. Any condition, observation or procedure can be a 
concern that has to be tracked. Utmost important is the relationship between 
constituting parts of a progress note and specially between progress notes by 
linking a progress note to conditions that are part of an earlier progress note. 
From this model a comprehensive hierarchical condition tree can be built. 
Several views, such as chronological, SOAP and condition-oriented, are possible. 
The clinical notes application is used in daily clinical practice. The model 
meets explicit design criteria and clinical needs.
CONCLUSIONS: With the comprehensive HL7 standard it is possible to model and map 
progress notes using SOAP headings and POMR methodology. We have developed a 
generic, flexible and applicable paradigm by using acts for each assessment that 
refer to a condition (1), by separating conditions from concerns (2), and by an 
extensive use of the working list act (3).

Development and evaluation of a crowdsourcing methodology for knowledge base 
construction: identifying relationships between clinical problems and 
medications.

OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel, crowdsourcing method for generating a knowledge 
base of problem-medication pairs that takes advantage of manually asserted links 
between medications and problems.
METHODS: Through iterative review, we developed metrics to estimate the 
appropriateness of manually entered problem-medication links for inclusion in a 
knowledge base that can be used to infer previously unasserted links between 
problems and medications.
RESULTS: Clinicians manually linked 231,223 medications (55.30% of prescribed 
medications) to problems within the electronic health record, generating 41,203 
distinct problem-medication pairs, although not all were accurate. We developed 
methods to evaluate the accuracy of the pairs, and after limiting the pairs to 
those meeting an estimated 95% appropriateness threshold, 11,166 pairs remained. 
The pairs in the knowledge base accounted for 183,127 total links asserted 
(76.47% of all links). Retrospective application of the knowledge base linked 
68,316 medications not previously linked by a clinician to an indicated problem 
(36.53% of unlinked medications). Expert review of the combined knowledge base, 
including inferred and manually linked problem-medication pairs, found a 
sensitivity of 65.8% and a specificity of 97.9%.
CONCLUSION: Crowdsourcing is an effective, inexpensive method for generating a 
knowledge base of problem-medication pairs that is automatically mapped to local 
terminologies, up-to-date, and reflective of local prescribing practices and 
trends.

The Swedish strategy and method for development of a national healthcare 
information architecture.

Rosenälv J(1), Lundell KH.

Author information:
(1)Center for eHealth in Sweden, Stockholm, Sweden. jessica.rosenalv@cehis.se

"We need a precise framework of regulations in order to maintain appropriate and 
structured health care documentation that ensures that the information maintains 
a sufficient level of quality to be used in treatment, in research and by the 
actual patient. The users shall be aided by clearly and uniformly defined terms 
and concepts, and there should be an information structure that clarifies what 
to document and how to make the information more useful. Most of all, we need to 
standardize the information, not just the technical systems." (eHälsa - nytta 
och näring, Riksdag report 2011/12:RFR5, p. 37). In 2010, the Swedish Government 
adopted the National e-Health - the national strategy for accessible and secure 
information in healthcare. The strategy is a revision and extension of the 
previous strategy from 2006, which was used as input for the most recent efforts 
to develop a national information structure utilizing business-oriented generic 
models. A national decision on healthcare informatics standards was made by the 
Swedish County Councils, which decided to follow and use EN/ISO 13606 as a 
standard for the development of a universally applicable information structure, 
including archetypes and templates. The overall aim of the Swedish strategy for 
development of National Healthcare Information Architecture is to achieve high 
level semantic interoperability for clinical content and clinical contexts. High 
level semantic interoperability requires consistently structured clinical data 
and other types of data with coherent traceability to be mapped to reference 
clinical models. Archetypes that are formal definitions of the clinical and 
demographic concepts and some administrative data were developed. Each archetype 
describes the information structure and content of overarching core clinical 
concepts. Information that is defined in archetypes should be used for different 
purposes. Generic clinical process model was made concrete and analyzed. For 
each decision-making step in the process where information is processed, the 
amount and type of information and its structure were defined in terms of 
reference templates. Reference templates manage clinical, administrative and 
demographic types of information in a specific clinical context. Based on a 
survey of clinical processes at the reference level, the identification of 
specific clinical processes such as diabetes and congestive heart failure in 
adults were made. Process-specific templates were defined by using reference 
templates and populated with information that was relevant to each health 
problem in a specific clinical context. Throughout this process, medical data 
for knowledge management were collected for each health problem. Parallel with 
the efforts to define archetypes and templates, terminology binding work is 
on-going. Different strategies are used depending on the terminology binding 
level.

BACKGROUND: Accurate clinical problem lists are critical for patient care, 
clinical decision support, population reporting, quality improvement, and 
research. However, problem lists are often incomplete or out of date.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a clinical alerting system, which uses inference 
rules to notify providers of undocumented problems, improves problem list 
documentation.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Inference rules for 17 conditions were constructed and 
an electronic health record-based intervention was evaluated to improve problem 
documentation. A cluster randomized trial was conducted of 11 participating 
clinics affiliated with a large academic medical center, totaling 28 primary 
care clinical areas, with 14 receiving the intervention and 14 as controls. The 
intervention was a clinical alert directed to the provider that suggested adding 
a problem to the electronic problem list based on inference rules. The primary 
outcome measure was acceptance of the alert. The number of study problems added 
in each arm as a pre-specified secondary outcome was also assessed. Data were 
collected during 6-month pre-intervention (11/2009-5/2010) and intervention 
(5/2010-11/2010) periods.
RESULTS: 17,043 alerts were presented, of which 41.1% were accepted. In the 
intervention arm, providers documented significantly more study problems 
(adjusted OR=3.4, p<0.001), with an absolute difference of 6277 additional 
problems. In the intervention group, 70.4% of all study problems were added via 
the problem list alerts. Significant increases in problem notation were observed 
for 13 of 17 conditions.
CONCLUSION: Problem inference alerts significantly increase notation of 
important patient problems in primary care, which in turn has the potential to 
facilitate quality improvement.

[High-quality hospital discharge summaries - general practitioners 
expectations].

[Article in German]

Bally K(1), Lingenhel S, Tschudi P.

Hospital discharge summaries ensure treatment continuity after hospital 
discharge. In Switzerland discharge letters are a celebrated custom and a tool 
for training young colleagues. The primary purpose is to guarantee high-quality 
care of patients treated by hospital staff and general practitioners. From the 
perspective of the patient's general practitioner discharge summaries should 
convey current and accurate medically important patient data to the physician 
responsible for follow-up care. In the era of highly developed electronic data 
transfer and introduction of diagnose related groups (DRGs), it will be 
necessary to transmit hospital discharge information selectively to different 
target groups. Nevertheless data protection and medical secret must be complied 
with.

Comparative analysis of the VA/Kaiser and NLM CORE problem subsets: an empirical 
study based on problem frequency.

Wright A(1), Feblowitz J, McCoy AB, Sittig DF.

Author information:

The problem list is a critical component of the electronic medical record, with 
implications for clinical care, provider communication, clinical decision 
support, quality measurement and research. However, many of its benefits depend 
on the use of coded terminologies. Two standard terminologies (ICD-9 and 
SNOMED-CT) are available for problem documentation, and two SNOMED-CT subsets 
(VA/KP and CORE) are available for SNOMED-CT users. We set out to examine these 
subsets, characterize their overlap and measure their coverage. We applied the 
subsets to a random sample of 100,000 records from Brigham and Women's Hospital 
to determine the proportion of problems covered. Though CORE is smaller (5,814 
terms vs. 17,761 terms for VA/KP), 94.8% of coded problem entries from BWH were 
in the CORE subset, while only 84.0% of entries had matches in VA/KP (p<0.001). 
Though both subsets had reasonable coverage, CORE was superior in our sample, 
and had fewer clinically significant gaps.

Automatically detecting problem list omissions of type 2 diabetes cases using 
electronic medical records.

Author information:

As part of a large-scale project to use DNA biorepositories linked with 
electronic medical record (EMR) data for research, we developed and validated an 
algorithm to identify type 2 diabetes cases in the EMR. Though the algorithm was 
originally created to support clinical research, we have subsequently re-applied 
it to determine if it could also be used to identify problem list gaps. We 
examined the problem lists of the cases that the algorithm identified in order 
to determine if a structured code for diabetes was present. We found that only 
just over half of patients identified by the algorithm had a corresponding 
structured code entered in their problem list. We analyze characteristics of 
this patient population and identify possible reasons for the problem list 
omissions. We conclude that application of such algorithms to the EMR can 
improve the quality of the problem list, thereby supporting satisfaction of 
Meaningful Use guidelines.

Center at Houston (UTHealth), Houston, TX, USA.

Increasing use of electronic health records requires comprehensive 
patient-centered views of clinical data. We describe a prototype knowledge base 
and SMART app that facilitates organization of patient medications by clinical 
problems, comprising a preliminary step in building such patient-centered views. 
The knowledge base includes 7,164,444 distinct problem-medication links, 
generated from RxNorm, SNOMED CT, and NDF-RT within the UMLS Metathesaurus. In 
an evaluation of the knowledge base applied to 5000 de-identified patient 
records, 22.4% of medications linked to an entry in the patient's active problem 
list, compared to 32.6% of medications manually linked by providers; 46.5% of 
total links were unique to the knowledge base, not added by providers. Expert 
review of a random patient subset estimated a sensitivity of 37.1% and 
specificity of 98.9%. The SMART API successfully utilized the knowledge base to 
generate problem-medication links for test patients. Future work is necessary to 
improve knowledge base sensitivity and efficiency.

(1)National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA. kwfung@nlm.nih.gov

Three Problem List Terminologies (PLT) were tested using a web-based application 
simulating a clinical data entry environment to evaluate coverage and coding 
efficiency. The three PLTs were: the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT, a 
clinical subset extracted from the full SNOMED CT and the PLT currently used at 
the Mayo Clinic. Candidate problem statements were randomly extracted from free 
text problem list entries contained in two electronic medical record systems. 
Physician reviewers searched for concepts in one of the three PLTs that most 
closely matched a problem statement. Altogether 45 reviewers reviewed 15 
problems each. The coverage of the much smaller CORE Subset was comparable to 
Clinical SNOMED for combined exact or partial matches. The CORE Subset required 
the shortest time to find a concept. This may be related to the smaller size of 
the pick lists for the CORE Subset.

Towards case-based medical learning in radiological decision making using 
content-based image retrieval.

Germany. PWelter@mi.rwth-aachen.de

BACKGROUND: Radiologists' training is based on intensive practice and can be 
improved with the use of diagnostic training systems. However, existing systems 
typically require laboriously prepared training cases and lack integration into 
the clinical environment with a proper learning scenario. Consequently, 
diagnostic training systems advancing decision-making skills are not well 
established in radiological education.
METHODS: We investigated didactic concepts and appraised methods appropriate to 
the radiology domain, as follows: (i) Adult learning theories stress the 
importance of work-related practice gained in a team of problem-solvers; (ii) 
Case-based reasoning (CBR) parallels the human problem-solving process; (iii) 
Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) can be useful for computer-aided diagnosis 
(CAD). To overcome the known drawbacks of existing learning systems, we 
developed the concept of image-based case retrieval for radiological education 
(IBCR-RE). The IBCR-RE diagnostic training is embedded into a didactic framework 
based on the Seven Jump approach, which is well established in problem-based 
learning (PBL). In order to provide a learning environment that is as similar as 
possible to radiological practice, we have analysed the radiological workflow 
and environment.
RESULTS: We mapped the IBCR-RE diagnostic training approach into the Image 
Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) framework, resulting in the proposed 
concept of the IRMAdiag training application. IRMAdiag makes use of the modular 
structure of IRMA and comprises (i) the IRMA core, i.e., the IRMA CBIR engine; 
and (ii) the IRMAcon viewer. We propose embedding IRMAdiag into hospital 
information technology (IT) infrastructure using the standard protocols Digital 
Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and Health Level Seven (HL7). 
Furthermore, we present a case description and a scheme of planned evaluations 
to comprehensively assess the system.
CONCLUSIONS: The IBCR-RE paradigm incorporates a novel combination of essential 
aspects of diagnostic learning in radiology: (i) Provision of work-relevant 
experiences in a training environment integrated into the radiologist's working 
context; (ii) Up-to-date training cases that do not require cumbersome 
preparation because they are provided by routinely generated electronic medical 
records; (iii) Support of the way adults learn while remaining suitable for the 
patient- and problem-oriented nature of medicine. Future work will address 
unanswered questions to complete the implementation of the IRMAdiag trainer.

Unpredictable yet frequently occurring exception situations pervade clinical 
care. Handling them properly often requires aberrant actions temporarily 
departing from normal practice. In this study, the authors investigated several 
exception-handling procedures provided in an electronic health records system 
for facilitating clinical documentation, which the authors refer to as 'data 
entry exit strategies.' Through a longitudinal analysis of computer-recorded 
usage data, the authors found that (1) utilization of the exit strategies was 
not affected by postimplementation system maturity or patient visit volume, 
suggesting clinicians' needs to 'exit' unwanted situations are persistent; and 
(2) clinician type and gender are strong predictors of exit-strategy usage. 
Drilldown analyses further revealed that the exit strategies were judiciously 
used and enabled actions that would be otherwise difficult or impossible. 
However, many data entries recorded via them could have been 'properly' 
documented, yet were not, and a considerable proportion containing temporary or 
incomplete information was never subsequently amended. These findings may have 
significant implications for the design of safer and more user-friendly 
point-of-care information systems for healthcare.

A method and knowledge base for automated inference of patient problems from 
structured data in an electronic medical record.

BACKGROUND: Accurate knowledge of a patient's medical problems is critical for 
clinical decision making, quality measurement, research, billing and clinical 
decision support. Common structured sources of problem information include the 
patient problem list and billing data; however, these sources are often 
inaccurate or incomplete.
OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate methods of automatically inferring patient 
problems from clinical and billing data, and to provide a knowledge base for 
inferring problems.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We identified 17 target conditions and designed and 
validated a set of rules for identifying patient problems based on medications, 
laboratory results, billing codes, and vital signs. A panel of physicians 
provided input on a preliminary set of rules. Based on this input, we tested 
candidate rules on a sample of 100,000 patient records to assess their 
performance compared to gold standard manual chart review. The physician panel 
selected a final rule for each condition, which was validated on an independent 
sample of 100,000 records to assess its accuracy.
RESULTS: Seventeen rules were developed for inferring patient problems. Analysis 
using a validation set of 100,000 randomly selected patients showed high 
sensitivity (range: 62.8-100.0%) and positive predictive value (range: 
79.8-99.6%) for most rules. Overall, the inference rules performed better than 
using either the problem list or billing data alone.
CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a set of rules for inferring patient 
problems. These rules have a variety of applications, including clinical 
decision support, care improvement, augmentation of the problem list, and 
identification of patients for research cohorts.

Clinician attitudes toward and use of electronic problem lists: a thematic 
analysis.

Wright A(1), Maloney FL, Feblowitz JC.

Author information:
(1)Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. awright5@partners.org

BACKGROUND: The clinical problem list is an important tool for clinical decision 
making, quality measurement and clinical decision support; however, problem 
lists are often incomplete and provider attitudes towards the problem list are 
poorly understood.
METHODS: An ethnographic study of healthcare providers conducted from April 2009 
to January 2010 was carried out among academic and community outpatient medical 
practices in the Greater Boston area across a wide range of medical and surgical 
specialties. Attitudes towards the problem list were then analyzed using 
grounded theory methods.
RESULTS: Attitudes were variable, and dimensions of variations fit into nine 
themes: workflow, ownership and responsibility, relevance, uses, content, 
presentation, accuracy, alternatives, support/education and one cross-cutting 
theme of culture.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant variation was observed in clinician attitudes towards

Clinical documentation is central to patient care. The success of electronic 
health record system adoption may depend on how well such systems support 
clinical documentation. A major goal of integrating clinical documentation into 
electronic heath record systems is to generate reusable data. As a result, there 
has been an emphasis on deploying computer-based documentation systems that 
prioritize direct structured documentation. Research has demonstrated that 
healthcare providers value different factors when writing clinical notes, such 
as narrative expressivity, amenability to the existing workflow, and usability. 
The authors explore the tension between expressivity and structured clinical 
documentation, review methods for obtaining reusable data from clinical notes, 
and recommend that healthcare providers be able to choose how to document 
patient care based on workflow and note content needs. When reusable data are 
needed from notes, providers can use structured documentation or rely on 
post-hoc text processing to produce structured data, as appropriate.

OBJECTIVE: To study existing problem list terminologies (PLTs), and to identify 
a subset of concepts based on standard terminologies that occur frequently in 
problem list data.
DESIGN: Problem list terms and their usage frequencies were collected from large 
healthcare institutions.
MEASUREMENT: The pattern of usage of the terms was analyzed. The local terms 
were mapped to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Based on the mapped 
UMLS concepts, the degree of overlap between the PLTs was analyzed.
RESULTS: Six institutions submitted 76,237 terms and their usage frequencies in 
14 million patients. The distribution of usage was highly skewed. On average, 
21% of unique terms already covered 95% of usage. The most frequently used 
14,395 terms, representing the union of terms that covered 95% of usage in each 
institution, were exhaustively mapped to the UMLS. 13,261 terms were 
successfully mapped to 6776 UMLS concepts. Less frequently used terms were 
generally less 'mappable' to the UMLS. The mean pairwise overlap of the PLTs was 
only 21% (median 19%). Concepts that were shared among institutions were used 
eight times more often than concepts unique to one institution. A SNOMED Problem 
List Subset of frequently used problem list concepts was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the frequently used problem list terms could be found in 
standard terminologies. The overlap between existing PLTs was low. The use of 
the SNOMED Problem List Subset will save developmental effort, reduce 
variability of PLTs, and enhance interoperability of problem list data.

Grid-based implementation of XDS-I as part of image-enabled EHR for regional 
healthcare in Shanghai.

PURPOSE: Due to the rapid growth of Shanghai city to 20 million residents, the 
balance between healthcare supply and demand has become an important issue. The 
local government hopes to ameliorate this problem by developing an image-enabled 
electronic healthcare record (EHR) sharing mechanism between certain hospitals. 
This system is designed to enable healthcare collaboration and reduce healthcare 
costs by allowing review of prior examination data obtained at other hospitals. 
Here, we present a design method and implementation solution of image-enabled 
EHRs (i-EHRs) and describe the implementation of i-EHRs in four hospitals and 
one regional healthcare information center, as well as their preliminary 
operating results.
METHODS: We designed the i-EHRs with service-oriented architecture (SOA) and 
combined the grid-based image management and distribution capability, which are 
compliant with IHE XDS-I integration profile. There are seven major components 
and common services included in the i-EHRs. In order to achieve quick response 
for image retrieving in low-bandwidth network environments, we use a JPEG2000 
interactive protocol and progressive display technique to transmit images from a 
Grid Agent as Imaging Source Actor to the PACS workstation as Imaging Consumer 
Actor.
RESULTS: The first phase of pilot testing of our image-enabled EHR was 
implemented in the Zhabei district of Shanghai for imaging document sharing and 
collaborative diagnostic purposes. The pilot testing began in October 2009; 
there have been more than 50 examinations daily transferred between the City 
North Hospital and the three community hospitals for collaborative diagnosis. 
The feedback from users at all hospitals is very positive, with respondents 
stating the system to be easy to use and reporting no interference with their 
normal radiology diagnostic operation.
CONCLUSIONS: The i-EHR system can provide event-driven automatic image delivery 
for collaborative imaging diagnosis across multiple hospitals based on work flow 
requirements. This project demonstrated that the grid-based implementation of 
IHE XDS-I for image-enabled EHR could scale effectively to serve a regional 
healthcare solution with collaborative imaging services. The feedback from users 
of community hospitals and large hospital is very positive.

BACKGROUND: The International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) standard 
aims to facilitate simultaneous and longitudinal comparisons of clinical primary 
care practice within and across country borders; it is also used for 
administrative purposes. This study evaluates the use of the original ICPC-1 and 
the more complete ICPC-2 Norwegian versions in electronic patient records.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of approximately 1.5 million ICPC 
codes and diagnoses that were collected over a 16-year period at 12 primary care 
sites in Norway. In the first phase of this period (transition phase, 1992-1999) 
physicians were allowed to not use an ICPC code in their practice while in the 
second phase (regular phase, 2000-2008) the use of an ICPC code was mandatory. 
The ICPC codes and diagnoses defined a problem event for each patient in the 
PROblem-oriented electronic MEDical record (PROMED). The main outcome measure of 
our analysis was the percentage of problem events in PROMEDs with inappropriate 
(or missing) ICPC codes and of diagnoses that did not map the latest ICPC-2 
classification. Specific problem areas (pneumonia, anaemia, tonsillitis and 
diabetes) were examined in the same context.
RESULTS: Codes were missing in 6.2% of the problem events; incorrect codes were 
observed in 4.0% of the problem events and text mismatch between the diagnoses 
and the expected ICPC-2 diagnoses text in 53.8% of the problem events. Missing 
codes were observed only during the transition phase while incorrect and 
inappropriate codes were used all over the 16-year period. The physicians 
created diagnoses that did not exist in ICPC. These 'new' diagnoses were used 
with varying frequency; many of them were used only once. Inappropriate ICPC-2 
codes were also observed in the selected problem areas and for both phases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that physicians did not adhere to the 
ICPC standard due to its incompleteness, i.e. lack of many clinically important 
diagnoses. This indicates that ICPC is inappropriate for the classification of 
problem events and the clinical practice in primary care.

Assessing the accuracy of an inter-institutional automated patient-specific 
health problem list.

Montreal, Qc, Canada. lise.poissant@umontreal.ca

BACKGROUND: Health problem lists are a key component of electronic health 
records and are instrumental in the development of decision-support systems that 
encourage best practices and optimal patient safety. Most health problem lists 
require initial clinical information to be entered manually and few integrate 
information across care providers and institutions. This study assesses the 
accuracy of a novel approach to create an inter-institutional automated health 
problem list in a computerized medical record (MOXXI) that integrates three 
sources of information for an individual patient: diagnostic codes from medical 
services claims from all treating physicians, therapeutic indications from 
electronic prescriptions, and single-indication drugs.
METHODS: Data for this study were obtained from 121 general practitioners and 
all medical services provided for 22,248 of their patients. At the opening of a 
patient's file, all health problems detected through medical service utilization 
or single-indication drug use were flagged to the physician in the MOXXI system. 
Each new arising health problem were presented as 'potential' and physicians 
were prompted to specify if the health problem was valid (Y) or not (N) or if 
they preferred to reassess its validity at a later time.
RESULTS: A total of 263,527 health problems, representing 891 unique problems, 
were identified for the group of 22,248 patients. Medical services claims 
contributed to the majority of problems identified (77%), followed by 
therapeutic indications from electronic prescriptions (14%), and 
single-indication drugs (9%). Physicians actively chose to assess 41.7% (n = 
106,950) of health problems. Overall, 73% of the problems assessed were 
considered valid; 42% originated from medical service diagnostic codes, 11% from 
single indication drugs, and 47% from prescription indications. Twelve percent 
of problems identified through other treating physicians were considered valid 
compared to 28% identified through study physician claims.
CONCLUSION: Automation of an inter-institutional problem list added over half of 
all validated problems to the health problem list of which 12% were generated by 
conditions treated by other physicians. Automating the integration of existing 
information sources provides timely access to accurate and relevant health 
problem information. It may also accelerate the uptake and use of electronic 
medical record systems.

Enhancing laboratory report contents to improve outpatient management of test 
results.

In today's environment, providers are extremely time-constrained. Assembling 
relevant contextual data to make decisions on laboratory results can take a 
significant amount of time from the day. The Regenstrief Institute has created a 
system which leverages data within Indiana Health Information Exchange's 
(IHIE's) repository, the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), to provide 
well-organized and contextual information on returning laboratory results to 
outpatient providers. The system described here uses data extracted from INPC to 
add historical test results, medication-dispensing events, visit information, 
and clinical reminders to traditional laboratory result reports. These "Enhanced 
Laboratory Reports" (ELRs) are seamlessly delivered to outpatient practices 
connected through IHIE via the DOCS4DOCS clinical messaging service. All 
practices, including those without electronic medical record systems, can 
receive ELRs. In this paper, the design and implementation issues in creating 
this system are discussed, and generally favorable preliminary results of 
attitudes by providers towards ELRs are reported.

BACKGROUND: An increase of diabetes prevalence of up to 80% is predicted in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by 2025 exceeding the worldwide 55%. Mortality rates of 
diabetes and HIV/AIDS are similar. Diabetes shares several common factors with 
HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The latter two health 
problems have been efficiently managed by an open source electronic medical 
record system (EMRS) in Latin America. Therefore a similar solution for diabetes 
in SSA could be extremely helpful.
OBJECTIVES: The aim was to design and validate a conceptual model for an EMRS to 
improve diabetes management in SSA making use of the HIV and TB experience.
METHODS: A review of the literature addressed diabetes care and management in 
SSA as well as existing examples of information and communication technology 
(ICT) use in SSA. Based on a need assessment conducted in SSA a conceptual model 
based on the traditionally structured healthcare system in SSA was mapped into a 
three-layer structure. Application modules were derived and a demonstrator 
programmed based on an open source EMRS. Then the approach was validated by SSA 
experts.
RESULTS: A conceptual model could be specified and validated which enhances a 
problem-oriented approach to diabetes management processes. The prototyp EMRS 
demonstrates options for a patient portal and simulation tools for education of 
health professional and patients in SSA.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to find IT solutions for diabetes care in SSA which 
follow the same efficiency concepts as HIV or TB modules in Latin America. The 
local efficiency and sustainability of the solution will, however, depend on 
training and changes in work behavior.

Content and structure of clinical problem lists: a corpus analysis.

In the interest of designing an automated high-level, longitudinal clinical 
summary of a patient record, we analyze traditional ways in which medical 
problems pertaining to the patient are summarized in the electronic health 
record. The patient problem list has become a commonly used proxy for a summary 
of patient history and automated methods have been proposed to generate it. 
However, little research has been conducted on how to structure the problem list 
in a manner most effective for supporting clinical care. This study analyzes the 
structure and content of the Past Medical History (PMH) sections of a large 
corpus of clinical notes, as a proxy for problem lists. Findings show that when 
listing patients history, physicians convey several semantic types of 
information, not only problems. Furthermore, they often group related concepts 
in a single line of the PMH. In contrast, traditional problem lists allow only a 
simple enumeration of coded terms. Content analysis goes on to reiterate the 
value of more complex representations as well as provide valuable data and 
guidelines for automated generation of a clinical summary.

Detailed problem lists that comply with JCAHO requirements are important 
components of electronic health records. Besides improving continuity of care 
electronic problem lists could serve as foundation infrastructure for clinical 
trial recruitment, research, biosurveillance and billing informatics modules. 
However, physicians rarely maintain problem lists. Our team is building a system 
using MetaMap and UMLS to automatically populate the problem list. We report our 
early results evaluating the application. Three physicians generated gold 
standard problem lists for 100 cardiology ambulatory progress notes. Our 
application had 88% sensitivity and 66% precision using a non-modified UMLS 
dataset. The systemâs misses concentrated in the group of ambiguous problem list 
entries (Chi-square=27.12 p<0.0001). In addition to the explicit entries, the 
notes included 10% implicit entry candidates. MetaMap and UMLS are readily 
applicable to automate the problem list. Ambiguity in medical documents has 
consequences for performance evaluation of automated systems.

t.austin@chime.ucl.ac.uk

INTRODUCTION: This paper presents work to define a representation for clinical 
research queries that can be used for the design of generic interfaces to 
electronic healthcare record (EHR) systems. Given the increasing prevalence of 
EHR systems, with the potential to accumulate life-long health records, 
opportunities exist to analyse and mine these for new knowledge. This potential 
is presently limited by many factors, one of which is the challenge of 
extracting information from them in order to execute a research query.
METHOD: There is limited pre-existing work on the generic specification of 
clinical queries. Sets of example queries were obtained from published studies 
and clinician reference groups. These were re-represented as structured logical 
expressions, from which a generalisable pattern (information model) was 
inferred. An iterative design and implementation approach was then pursued to 
refine the model and evaluate it.
RESULTS: This paper presents a set of requirements for the generic 
representation of clinical research queries, and an information model to 
represent any arbitrary such query. A middleware component was implemented as an 
interface to an existing system that holds 20,000 anonymised cancer EHRs in 
order to validate the model. This component was interfaced in turn to a query 
design and results presentation tool developed by the Open University, to permit 
end user demonstrations and feedback as part of the evaluation.
CONCLUSION: Although it is difficult to separate cleanly the evaluation of a 
theoretical model from its implementation, the empirical evaluation of the 
query-execution interface revealed that clinical queries of the kinds studied 
could all be represented and executed successfully. However, performance was a 
problem and this paper outlines some of the challenges faced in building generic 
components to handle specialised data structures on a large scale. The 
limitations of this work are also discussed. The work complements many years of 
European research and standardisation on the interoperable communication of 
electronic health records, by proposing a way in which one or more EHR systems 
might be queried in a standardised way.

Koper, Slovenia. matic.meglic@gmail.com

Information technology has the potential to improve and support the treatment of 
depression. Use of clinical guidelines can improve outcome of treatment, but 
implementation of guidelines is a demanding process and the resulting user 
compliance is often poor. Electronic health records, clinical decision support 
systems and other information technology tools seem at first glance to be a 
preferable way to implement clinical guidelines since they require user's active 
and problem oriented participation. This article reviews attempts made so far at 
use of information tools for implementation of clinical guidelines for 
depression treatment and discusses their effects. It turns out that there are 
few existing solutions, ambiguous effects and that usage is often limited. In 
future the factors determining development of successful electronic tools for 
clinical guidelines implementation will need to be further specified. Further 
research projects are underway in Slovenia to investigate these issues.

Expectations for the next generation of electronic patient records in primary 
care: a triangulated study.

Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Medisinsk Teknisk 
Forskningssenter (MTFS), N-7489 Trondheim, Norway. tom.christensen@ntnu.no

BACKGROUND: Although primary care physicians are satisfied users of electronic 
patient records (EPRs) in Norway today, EPR systems may not have reached their 
full potential. We studied primary care physicians' needs and experiences in 
relation to EPRs and analysed potential improvements for today's EPR systems. 
RESPONDENTS AND METHODS: This is a triangulated study that compares qualitative 
and quantitative data from focus groups, observations of primary care encounters 
and a questionnaire survey.
RESULTS: General practioners (GPs) were not satisfied with the level of 
availability of information within EPR systems. They were especially concerned 
about follow-up for chronic disease and dealing with patients with multiple 
conditions. Many expressed a desire for reminders and easier access to clinical 
guidelines under normal working conditions, as well as the possibility of 
consultations with specialists from their EPR systems. GPs placed importance on 
the ability to communicate electronically with patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Progress toward a problem-oriented EPR system based on episodes of 
care that includes decision support is necessary to satisfy the needs expressed 
by GPs. Further research could solve the problem of integration of functionality 
for consultation with specialists and integration with patient held records. 
Results from this study could contribute to further development of the next 
generation of EPRs in primary care, as well as inspire the application of EPRs 
in other parts of the health sector.

Problem-oriented patient record model as a conceptual foundation for a 
multi-professional electronic patient record.

OBJECTIVE: It is widely accepted that the development of electronic patient 
records, or even of a common electronic patient record, is one possible way to 
improve cooperation and data communication between nurses and physicians. Yet, 
little has been done so far to develop a common conceptual model for both 
medical and nursing patient records, which is a first challenge that should be 
met to set up a common electronic patient record. In this paper, we describe a 
problem-oriented conceptual model and we show how it may suit both nursing and 
medical perspectives in a hospital setting.
METHODS: We started from existing nursing theory and from an initial model 
previously set up for primary care. In a hospital pilot site, a 
multi-disciplinary team refined this model using one large and complex clinical 
case (retrospective study) and nine ongoing cases (prospective study). An 
internal validation was performed through hospital-wide multi-professional 
interviews and through discussions around a graphical user interface prototype. 
To assess the consistency of the model, a computer engineer specified it. 
Finally, a Belgian expert working group performed an external assessment of the 
model.
RESULTS: As a basis for a common patient record we propose a simple 
problem-oriented conceptual model with two levels of meta-information. The model 
is mapped with current nursing theories and it includes the following concepts: 
"health care element", "health approach", "health agent", "contact", 
"subcontact" and "service". These concepts, their interrelationships and some 
practical rules for using the model are illustrated in this paper. Our results 
are compatible with ongoing standardization work at the Belgian and European 
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Our conceptual model is potentially a foundation for a 
multi-professional electronic patient record that is problem-oriented and 
therefore patient-centred.

The work practice of medical secretaries and the implementation of electronic 
health records in Denmark.

pernille@plan.aau.dk

The introduction of electronic health records will entail substantial 
organisational changes to the clinical and administrative staff in hospitals. 
Hospital owners in Denmark have predicted that these changes will render up to 
half of medical secretaries redundant. The present study however shows that 
medical secretaries have a great variety of duties, and often act as the 
organisational "glue" or connecting thread between other professional groups at 
the hospital. The aim of this study is to obtain a detailed understanding of the 
pluralism of work tasks the medical secretaries perform. It is concluded that 
clinicians as well as nurses depend on medical secretaries, and therefore to 
reduce the number of secretaries because electronic health record systems are 
implemented needs very careful thinking, planning and discussion with the other 
professions involved.

Reducing errors and risk in a prenatal network with an electronic medical 
record.

College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York 10461-2373, 
USA. pbernste@montefiore.org

In 2002 the Institute of Medicine called for implementation of information 
technologies in health care settings to improve quality of care and reduce the 
incidence of medical errors. Nowhere is this need more critical than in 
obstetrics. In recent years numerous electronic prenatal medical records have 
become available. To date there has been little literature to identify what 
constitutes the important features in these systems, nor research into whether 
these systems actually improve the quality of care or the outcome of 
pregnancies. In this article we will elucidate some of the features that we feel 
are critical if we are to achieve these goals. Some of these features are: (1) 
availability across a computer network so that providers can access the record 
in a variety of settings, (2) simplicity of the user interface to ensure 
provider compliance with the system, (3) an intelligent system to encourage 
completeness of documentation in the medical record, (4) a problem-oriented 
obstetric chart so that no issue is overlooked and each is adequately addressed, 
and (5) administrative features to allow evaluation to ensure improved quality 
of care. These features together, we believe, will help to minimize medical 
errors, improve patient outcomes and reduce liability exposure.

Effect of electronic patient record use on mortality in End Stage Renal Disease, 
a model chronic disease: retrospective analysis of 9 years of prospectively 
collected data.

BACKGROUND: In chronic disease, health information technology promises but has 
yet to demonstrate improved outcomes and decreased costs. The main aim of the 
study was to determine the effects on mortality and cost of an electronic 
patient record used in daily patient care in a model chronic disease, End Stage 
Renal Disease, treated by chronic maintenance hemodialysis. Dialysis treatment 
is highly regulated, and near uniform in treatment modalities and drugs used.
METHODS: The particular electronic patient record, patient-centered and 
extensively coded, was used first in patient care in 3 dialysis units in New 
York, NY in 1998, 1999, and 2000. All data were stored "live"; none were 
archived. By December 31, 2006, the patients had been treated by maintenance 
hemodialysis for a total of 3924 years. A retrospective analysis was made using 
query tools embedded in the software. The United States Renal Data System 
dialysis population served as controls. In all there were 1790 patients, with 
many underlying primary diseases and multiple comorbid conditions affecting many 
organ systems. Year by year mortality, hospital admissions, and staffing were 
analyzed, and the data were compared with national data compiled by the United 
States Renal Data System.
RESULTS: Analyzed by calendar year after electronic patient record 
implementation, mortality decreased strikingly. In years 3-9 mortality was lower 
than in years 1-2 by 23%, 48%, and 34% in the 3 units, and was 37%, 37%, and 35% 
less than that reported by the United States Renal Data System. Clinical 
staffing was 25% fewer per 100 patients than the national average, thereby 
lowering costs.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an electronic 
patient record, albeit of particular design, can have a favorable effect on 
outcomes and cost in chronic disease. That the population studied has many 
underlying diseases affecting all organ systems suggests that the electronic 
patient record design may enable application to many fields of medical practice.

The nodes focusing tool for clinical course data of hypergraph structure in the 
ontological framework CSX output from POMR-based EMR system.

Knowledge management is one of the significant issues in this century. In 
medical informatics, the concept of ontology is an important current topic. In 
addition, there is great interest in knowledge acquisition from clinical data. 
When doctors use clinical information systems (CIS), their operation implicitly 
represents, to some extent, their thinking processes with clear reasons and 
goals according to their intent. If we can capture such resources in an 
appropriate representation, considerable empirical knowledge could be utilized 
in various research fields. With this prospect, the authors built an 
experimental CIS and a nodes-focusing tool for abstracting a summary of the 
clinical course being examined. The information model is based on a thinking 
process model, and data are represented in the ontological framework CSX. Then 
we showed the knowledge-abstracting procedures with this tool. Some domain 
experts and intern students showed great interest. The authors thereby concluded 
that such an empirical knowledge acquisition environment is useful for research, 
education, and so on.

From a conceptual problem-oriented electronic patient record model to running 
systems: a nationwide assessment.

BACKGROUND: The development of problem-oriented conceptual models for electronic 
patient record (EPR) systems can improve data communication between health 
professionals. But little has been done so far to investigate to what extent it 
is possible to implement such models in operational EPR systems.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we measure the conformance between a conceptual model 
and the various ways it is implemented within general practitioners' (GPs') 
electronic patient records.
METHODS: We started from a simple problem-oriented conceptual model and we 
defined an original discriminating method to assess its implementation. This 
method is scenario-based (dummy patient), functional, and relative (comparison 
between software systems). Each implementation is assessed by two evaluators and 
the final result is a "success/failure" score. The assessment was performed 
within the scope of the official Belgian accreditation procedure for GPs' 
electronic patient records, which is voluntary, publicly funded, and based on a 
dynamic quality improvement paradigm. Almost all Belgian GPs' software systems 
(17) were assessed. The robustness of our results was assessed through a 
sensitivity analysis.
RESULTS: We found that 65% (11/17) of the software systems currently used 
succeeded in implementing the problem-oriented conceptual model with a high 
confidence level (error rate<10%). The results were widely accepted by the 
software developers.
CONCLUSIONS: A problem-oriented conceptual model can be successfully implemented 
in many operational EPR systems. The quality of the implementation can be 
assessed. Our results could be used at the international level to improve 
semantic interoperability between patient information systems, for instance in 
relation to broader conceptual models such as the European CONTsys pre-norm.

Data acquisition behaviors during inpatient results review: implications for 
problem-oriented data displays.

Post A(1), Harrison J Jr.

Author information:

University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.

Problem-oriented electronic medical records may have significant advantages over 
source-oriented organization of patient data. However, reorganizing data in this 
fashion may have unexpected consequences for the clinical decision-making 
process. To determine what these consequences might be, we conducted a pilot 
study using verbal protocols and video screen capture to characterize physician 
subjects' use of a traditional laboratory data display while reviewing 
unfamiliar inpatient cases. We found that subjects navigated to the laboratory 
display primarily to seek evidence confirming a result or problem identified 
elsewhere in the case. Additionally, 22% of the time subjects spontaneously 
reviewed anomalous findings and results related to other known problems. These 
results suggest that physicians have learned complex data acquisition behaviors 
for efficient interaction with source-oriented displays, and further study is 
needed to ensure that problem-oriented medical records do not lose the benefits 
of these behaviors.

On educating about medical data management - the other side of the electronic 
health record.

Author information:
(1)Institute for Medical Informatics, Technical University of Braunschweig, 
Muehlenpfordtstr. 23, 38106 Braunschweig, Germany. r.haux@mi.tu-bs.de

OBJECTIVES: To summarize background, challenges, objectives, and methods for the 
usability of patient data, in particular with respect to their multiple use, and 
to point out how to lecture medical data management.
METHODS: Analyzing the literature, providing an example based on Simpson's 
paradox and summarizing research and education in the field of medical data 
management, respectively health information management (in German: Medizinische 
Dokumentation).
RESULTS: For the multiple use of patient data, three main categories of use can 
be identified: patient-oriented (or casuistic) analysis, patient-group 
reporting, and analysis for clinical studies. A so-called documentation 
protocol, related to study plans in clinical trials, supports the multiple use 
of data from the electronic health record in order to obtain valid, 
interpretable results. Lectures on medical data management may contain modules 
on introduction, basic concepts of clinical data management and coding systems, 
important medical coding systems (e.g. ICD, SNOMED, TNM, UMLS), typical medical 
documentation systems (e.g. on patient records, clinical and epidemiological 
registers), utilization of clinical data management systems, planning of medical 
coding systems and of clinical data management systems, hospital information 
systems and the electronic patient record, and on data management in clinical 
studies.
CONCLUSION: Usability, the ultimate goal of recording and managing patient data, 
requires, besides technical considerations, in addition appropriate methodology 
on medical data management, especially if data is intended to be used for 
multiple purposes, e.g. for patient care and quality management and clinical 
research. Medical data management should be taught in health and biomedical 
informatics programs.

Is it possible for nurses and doctors to form a useful clinical overview of an 
EHR?

Neve K(1), Kragh Iversen R, Andersen CK.

Author information:
(1)Health Informatics. CSC Scandihealth, Aarhus, Denmark. knev@csc.com

After implementation of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) at the hospital in 
Frederikshavn (Denmark) the doctors expressed that they had lost the overview of 
the information in the medical record and that it takes appreciably longer time 
to use the EHR. The future Electronic Health Records in Denmark will be 
structured according to the Fundamentals of the Danish Basic EHR Model, the 
"G-EPJ" Process Model. In addition, the model is interdisciplinary, problem 
oriented and based on clinical continuity. 16 clinicians from the hospital of 
Frederikshavn have joined in four focus-group interviews to clarify which 
information is used to form a clinical overview. The interviews have been 
analyzed methodically referring to Grounded Theory, and we have identified 8 
factors which support the clinical overview, and besides that doctors and nurses 
form the clinical overview in different ways. Systematic information retrieval 
has been carried out to clarify how to optimize on-screen data presentation. 
Doctors, nurses and systems developers have worked together during 6 workshops, 
which has resulted in a set of screen images that support the nursing overview 
at the change of shift and the medical overview at ward rounds, respectively. 
The value of these screen images for the clinical overview has been tested in a 
real work situation at Roskilde Hospital, Denmark, in December 2005. And results 
show that the need for retrieving information from other documentation sources 
fell markedly when using an EHR instead of the usual paper-based record.

From punched cards to computerized patient records: a personal journey.

Peterson HE.

OBJECTIVES: This paper presents the early history of the development of CPR in 
Sweden, the importance of international cooperation and standardisation and how 
this cooperation has been facilitated by IMIA, the European Union and the 
standards organisations. It ends with the lessons learned after 35 years of 
experience put together by the Swedish Institute for Health Services 
Development, SPRI, in a 5 year project initiated by the Swedish Government and 
with participation of most health care providers in the country.
METHODS: Starting with the first attempts to use punched cards to store and use 
patient information for clinical use the author describes his troublesome and 
difficult road to a Computerized Patient Record that could be used both for the 
work with the patient and as a tool to follow up both the diagnostic and 
therapeutic processes and for clinical research.
RESULTS: The most important results of the efforts to develop a computerized 
patient record in Sweden are published in many reports, among them three SPRI 
reports published in the late 1990s, and they are: Standardized information 
architecture, a common terminology, rules for communication, security and 
safety, electronic addresses to all units and users and an agreed upon patient 
and user identification.
CONCLUSIONS: The future CPR must be problem oriented, capable of only adding new 
information instead of repeating already-known data and be available in real 
time regardless of geographic location. It must be possible to present the 
information in the CPR as 'views' where the healthcare provider has stated in 
advance the information needed for his patients. There can be a number of 
'views' for different occasions.

The expanding functionalities of EHR require valid, medical problem list. This 
study describes the preliminary validation of an automated problem list. A total 
of 5482 health problems were documented in the system for 1535 patients. 
Sixty-six percent of all health problems were automated by the system through 
available information on administrative databases and only 3.6% of those were 
rejected by physicians. Further validation of the system's automated problem 
list is being conducted.

The CONTENT project: a problem-oriented, episode-based electronic patient record 
in primary care.

Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. gunter.laux@med.uni-heidelberg.de

In order to obtain a proper knowledge base in primary care, a form of electronic 
patient record is needed that takes into account the specific characteristics of 
the doctor-patient encounter, the patient population, the presentation of 
diseases and the associated prevalences. However, in real life this has not 
happened for several reasons. For the most part, existing patient records are 
determined by invoicing requirements rather than by endeavours to meet the 
intrinsic needs of primary care. CONTENT (CONTinuous morbidity registration 
Epidemiologic NeTwork) is an ambitious scientific project in Germany to 
establish a system for adequate record keeping and analysis in primary care. 
Based on a classification system designed for the special situation of primary 
care, a scientific network is being established consisting of participating 
surgeries, general practitioners, computer scientists and statisticians. The 
project is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. 
The aims are strictly scientific and the underlying hypothesis is that the 
knowledge-gaining process can be accelerated by combining the experience of 
many, especially with respect to complex interactions of factors and the 
analysis of rare events. Aside from maintaining a morbidity registry, within the 
CONTENT framework various prospective and retrospective studies on particular 
epidemiological and health economic research topics will be conducted.

Representation of ophthalmology concepts by electronic systems: intercoder 
agreement among physicians using controlled terminologies.

Hwang JC(1), Yu AC, Casper DS, Starren J, Cimino JJ, Chiang MF.

Author information:
(1)Department of Ophthalmology, Columbia University College of Physicians and 
Surgeons, New York, New York 10032, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To assess intercoder agreement for ophthalmology concepts by 3 
physician coders using 5 controlled terminologies (International Classification 
of Diseases 9, Clinical Modification [ICD9CM]; Current Procedural Terminology, 
fourth edition; Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes [LOINC]; 
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine, Clinical Terms [SNOMED-CT]; and Medical 
Entities Dictionary).
DESIGN: Noncomparative case series.
PARTICIPANTS: Five complete ophthalmology case presentations selected from a 
publicly available journal.
METHODS: Each case was parsed into discrete concepts. Electronic or paper 
browsers were used independently by 3 physician coders to assign a code for 
every concept in each terminology. A match score representing adequacy of 
assignment for each concept was assigned on a 3-point scale (0, no match; 1, 
partial match; 2, complete match). For every concept, the level of intercoder 
agreement was determined by 2 methods: (1) based on exact code matching with 
assignment of complete agreement when all coders assigned the same code, partial 
agreement when 2 coders assigned the same code, and no agreement when all coders 
assigned different codes, and (2) based on manual review for semantic 
equivalence of all assigned codes by an independent ophthalmologist to classify 
intercoder agreement for each concept as complete agreement, partial agreement, 
or no agreement. Subsequently, intercoder agreement was calculated in the same 
manner for the subset of concepts judged to have adequate coverage by each 
terminology, based on receiving a match score of 2 by at least 2 of the 3 
coders.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intercoder agreement in each controlled terminology: 
complete, partial, or none.
RESULTS: Cases were parsed into 242 unique concepts. When all concepts were 
analyzed by manual review, the proportion of complete intercoder agreement 
ranged from 12% (LOINC) to 44% (SNOMED-CT), and the difference in intercoder 
agreement between LOINC and all other terminologies was statistically 
significant (P<0.004). When only concepts with adequate terminology were 
analyzed by manual review, the proportion of complete intercoder agreement 
ranged from 33% (LOINC) to 64% (ICD9CM), and there were no statistically 
significant differences in intercoder agreement among any pairs of 
terminologies.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of intercoder agreement for ophthalmic concepts in 
existing controlled medical terminologies is imperfect. Intercoder 
reproducibility is essential for accurate and consistent electronic 
representation of medical data.

Evaluation of Medical Problem Extraction from Electronic Clinical Documents 
Using MetaMap Transfer (MMTx).

Meystre S(1), Haug PJ.

(1)Department of Medical Informatics, University of Utah School of Medicine, 
Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S.

To improve the use and quality of the electronic Problem List, which is at the 
heart of the problem-oriented medical record in development in our institution 
(Intermountain Health Care, Utah, U.S.), we developed an Automated Problem List 
system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. A key part of this 
system is a module that automatically extracts potential medical problems from 
free-text clinical documents. The NLP module uses MMTx, developed at the U.S. 
National Library of Medicine. Negation detection was added to this application 
by adapting a negation detection algorithm called NegEx. To evaluate the 
adequacy of the performance of the NLP module for our Automated Problem List 
system, we evaluated it with 160 electronic clinical documents of different 
types. Two different data sets for MMTx were used: the default full UMLS data 
set and a customised subset adapted to detect the set of 80 medical problems we 
are interested in. With the default data set, we measured a recall of 0.74 (95% 
CI 0.68-0.8) and a precision of 0.76 (0.69-0.82). The customised subset had a 
significantly better recall of 0.9 (0.85-0.94), and a non-significantly 
different precision of 0.69 (0.63-0.75).

University, Uppsala, Sweden.Maria.Hagglund@medsci.uu.se

The coexistence of different information systems that are unable to communicate 
with each other is a persistent problem in health care in general, and in shared 
care in particular. This is especially critical when it comes to information 
access needed at the point of care, e.g. in the patient's home. The purpose of 
this paper is to present the technical architecture of a virtual health record 
(VHR) that both integrates information from different electronic health records 
(EHRs) and allows for documenting at the point of care using mobile devices. The 
VHR supports a seamless information and communication flow between different 
care providers giving them mobile access to selected patient-oriented 
information. A service oriented system architecture where database functionality 
and services are separated has been implemented. This guarantees flexibility 
with regard to changed functional demands and allows third party systems to 
interact with the platform in a standardised way. Major requirements for the VHR 
have been documentation support at the point of care, integrated presentation of 
the information from different feeder systems, and the possibility of offline 
access to the data on handheld devices. Therefore, publishing was chosen for the 
integration design. A patient centred XML schema is published as an interface 
for integration with the information broker. The feeder systems deliver their 
information in XML.-files that are mapped against the ideal schema and inserted 
into the mediator database. The paper describes both an online web application 
and an offline solution that was implemented on personal digital assistants 
(PDAs). The system has been introduced in a Swedish home care district with an 
established fiber-optical network infrastructure connecting all the locations 
forming the study site.

Improved documentation of wound care with a structured encounter form in the 
pediatric emergency department.

Author information:
(1)Division of Emergency Medicine, Children's Hospital and Health Center, San 
Diego, CA 92123-4282, USA. jkanegaye@chsd.org

OBJECTIVE: Accurate and complete documentation may enhance reimbursement and 
compliance with financial intermediary regulations, protect against litigation, 
and improve patient care. We measured the effect of introduction of a structured 
encounter form on the completeness of documentation of pediatric wound 
management in a teaching hospital.
METHODS: The Children's Hospital Emergency Department introduced a structured 
encounter form for use in the documentation of wound care in place of the 
existing free-text dictation method. Attending physicians and trainees, all 
unaware of the study, had the option of using the form in place of free-text 
dictation for patients with lacerations requiring closure. We abstracted 100 
consecutive free-text dictations from patients treated before the form's 
introduction. Following a 3-month run-in period, we abstracted 100 consecutive 
structured wound records. We compared the 2 chart types for completeness of 
documentation based on 20 predetermined criteria relevant to pediatric wound 
care.
RESULTS: Overall completeness of documentation improved with structured forms 
(80% vs 68% for free text, P < .001), with significant improvements in 6 of 20 
individual criteria. Trainees demonstrated improvement in documentation with the 
structured form, with the greatest improvements among senior-level residents. 
Documentation of the general physical examination worsened with structured 
charting.
DISCUSSION: In an academic pediatric emergency department, the use of a 
structured complaint-specific form improved overall completeness of wound-care 
documentation. Structured encounter forms may provide for more standardized 
documentation for a variety of pediatric chief complaints, thereby facilitating 
communication and ultimately transition to template-driven systems in 
anticipation of an electronic medical record.

Trends in the prevalence and management of diagnosed type 2 diabetes 1994-2001 
in England and Wales.

BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. 
Its prevalence appears to be increasing. Guidelines exist regarding its 
management. Recommendations regarding drug therapy have changed. Little is known 
about the influence of these guidelines and changed recommendations on the 
actual management of patients with type 2 diabetes. This study aims to document 
trends in the prevalence, drug treatment and recording of measures related to 
the management of type 2 diabetes; and to assess whether recommended targets can 
be met.
METHODS: The population comprised subjects registered between 1994 and 2001 with 
74 general practices in England and Wales which routinely contribute to the 
Doctors' Independent Network database. Approximately 500,000 patients and 10,000 
type 2 diabetics were registered in each year.
RESULTS: Type 2 diabetes prevalence rose from 17/1000 in 1994 to 25/1000 in 
2001. Drug therapy has changed: use of long acting sulphonylureas is falling 
while that of short acting sulphonylureas, metformin and newer therapies 
including glitazones is increasing. Electronic recording of HbA1c, blood 
pressure, cholesterol and weight have risen steadily, and improvements in 
control of blood pressure and cholesterol levels have occurred. However, 
glycaemic control has not improved, and obesity has increased. The percentage 
with a BMI under 25 kg/m2 fell from 27.0% in 1994 to 19.4% in 2001 (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing. Its primary care 
management has changed in accordance with best evidence. Monitoring has 
improved, but further improvement is possible. Despite this, glycaemic control 
has not improved, while the prevalence of obesity in the diabetic population is 
rising.

Integrating electronic guidelines into the diagnostic cycle.

Winnem OM(1).

Author information:
(1)SINTEF ICT, S.P. Andersensvei 15b, 7465 Trondheim, Norway.

Clinical guidelines have been used for diagnostic and treatment purposes, and 
lately much of this information has become available in electronic formats. In 
Norway a medical electronic handbook has been developed [1] to give support for 
the physician, deciding upon diagnoses and treatment. This electronic handbook 
is now widely used, but not in a systematic fashion - due to lack of 
user-friendliness. The lack of integration with EPR systems and, more 
importantly, the lack of integration with the working process, are additional 
obstacles. In order to improve the usability of the electronic handbook, we have 
developed a prototype where the commercially-available handbook is tightly 
integrated with the EPR system and where the EPR system is based on a 
problem-based approach. The prototype is focused on providing support to the 
diagnostic process, treatment planning, documentation and pointers to extended 
knowledge support. The integration of knowledge support and the EPR system was 
based on a semantic model representation in the middleware and an XML-based 
representation of the knowledge content within a SQL database. In addition to 
clinical guidelines, the ICPC-2[2] codes and their inclusion and exclusion 
criteria are used to support the diagnostic task.

Automated medical problem list generation: towards a patient timeline.

California-Los Angeles, 924 Westwood Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA.

The problem-oriented electronic medical record has been investigated as an 
alternative to source-oriented organization of patient data. At the core of a 
problem-oriented view is the medical problem list. Maintenance of the medical 
problem list is often manual, making it highly user dependent. We detail the 
beginnings of an automated medical problem list generator based on ICD-9: given 
a set of ICD-9 codes associated with a patient record, the system maps the codes 
(and related data) to an anatomy-centric hierarchy. 1 million patient encounters 
from an outpatient setting were reviewed to generate a unique set of 7,890 ICD-9 
codes. Natural language processing of the ICD-9 string descriptions identified 
1,981 anatomical terms, which were subsequently mapped to one of 21 anatomical 
categories. The output of the medical problem list generator was then used to 
create a problem-oriented, gestalt view of a patient's medical record. 
Preliminary evaluation of the generator revealed 100% recall, but only 60% 
precision. This initial work has highlighted several issues in defining a 
medical problem list, including questions of granularity and performance 
trade-offs.

The paper describes the experiences with a Belgian Primary Care data Network 
from 1999 till 2002. Three cycles of data collection have been performed. The 
network involves about 300 general practitioners (GPs) and up to 8 different 
software packages. This network is semi-anonymous, semi-automatic and mixed 
(paper and electronic with various software's). For the coming next years, 
efforts should be focused on solving some frequently occurring problems with the 
data collection through the EPR, such as a considerable number of data lacking 
and the fact that GPs do not always use the problem oriented structure of the 
EPR (Electronic Patient Record). Afterwards, more promising usage could be 
considered and developed such as repeated data collection using a same GPs' 
sample, long-term recording studies, usage of larger GPs' samples, etc.

Regional repositories, reintermediation and the new GMS contract: cardiovascular 
disease in Tayside.

f.m.sullivan@dundee.ac.uk

BACKGROUND: The new contract for general medical practitioners will make 
increasing demands on the primary care informatics community. There are a number 
of potential ways to provide reports which meet the requirements for data on the 
quality of care being provided by practices. In Scotland there are four 
components of the national information technology strategy which make meaningful 
comparisons of data possible.
OBJECTIVE: Using cardiovascular data as an example, to describe how the 
community health index number, managed clinical networks (MCNs), increasing 
consistency of Read codes, and regional repositories of data make the 
acquisition, processing and use of data more straightforward.
METHOD: The cardiovascular MCN collects the majority of its data electronically 
and four properties are crucial to its success: automatic collection of 
electronic data from many sources, prioritisation of data derived from multiple 
sources, record linkage processes, and manual validation of electronic data.
RESULTS: Clinicians in primary and secondary care enter data during 
consultations and see the results of consultations recorded elsewhere. Because 
all data from the region are able to be Read coded according to prespecified 
templates, we are able to indicate to practices where they are in relation to 
the new contract targets and indicate which patients need to be seen, or 
excluded from, calculations.
CONCLUSION: Effectively integrated management is facilitated by provision of 
regular prompted recall and review of people with chronic disease by 
multidisciplinary teams collaborating across the health service and into the 
community. In Scotland, use of newer informatics tools are proving to be useful 
contributions from primary care computing to equitable, evidence-based care.

UK. phil@hicomm.demon.co.uk

There has been massive investment in the development of clinical terminologies 
for use in electronic patient records. However, there has been little published 
evidence for the added value for primary care that implementation of such a 
terminology would offer. This paper outlines a methodology that has been used to 
compare two existing coding schemes (Read codes 5 byte set and Clinical Terms 
Version 3-CTV3) and demonstrates their relative performance using a 
certainty-agreement diagram. In the study described, CTV3 offers improved 
accuracy and consistency with improved usability. The potential advantages of 
the recently released terminology, SNOMED Clinical Terms, are briefly considered 
in this context.

How will practices cope with information for the new GMS contract? Coronary 
heart disease data recording in five Scottish practices.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether practices will be ready for the data 
reporting requirements for the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract, 
using coronary heart disease (CHD) as an example.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic general practitioner (GP) records of all CHD patients 
in five Scottish practices, validated by manual searches in 50 randomly selected 
patients in each practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recording of family history, smoking status, blood 
pressure (BP), diabetes testing, aspirin therapy and cholesterol measurement.
RESULTS: It is extremely easy for practices with completely electronic patient 
records to extract a disease register (mean 10 min, range 38 sec to 3 hr 6 min). 
Extraction of a complete dataset takes several days if it involves checking 
through paper records, whereas setting up and running a search from electronic 
records is possible in less than two hours. If practices use the same clinical 
system and identical data entry templates, the data can be directly compared. 
Some items that are easily recorded as part of routine clinical practice, such 
as prescribing of aspirin, are well recorded, but others, such as BP recording, 
are more of a problem. One hundred percent of the CHD patients sampled had a BP 
recording within the previous year, but some practices had these data in the 
paper records where they were not readily accessible.
CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that in Scotland there is a high level of testing and 
recording of all the important information regarding patients with recorded CHD, 
irrespective of whether practices have fully electronic records, paper-based 
records, or a mixture of the two. If practices have fully electronic patient 
records, the information can be extracted easily, but unless there is a standard 
template, the information can only be viewed in isolation and is of little value 
for comparative purposes.

A conceptual model for documentation of clinical information in the EHR.

Asp L(1), Petersen J.

Author information:
(1)asp@sst.dk

At a national level in Denmark the development of a Conceptual Model for 
Communication in Electronic Health Records (EHR) has moved towards a two-folded 
structure, i.e. a conceptual model for documentation of clinical information, 
the Clinical Process, and a Reference Information Model. The coupled structure 
derived in the final phase of the development of the Conceptual Model for 
Communication in EHR by the end of year 2001. This was inspired by the in-put 
and collaboration of several parties in the Danish healthcare sector throughout 
the period of development from 1999 to the current version 1.01 of the national 
standard was launched by The National Board of Health in January 2002. The 
modelling of the Clinical Process meets the need for a more clinical 
understanding of how the use of information technology, i.e. EHR, can support 
the work processes of shared-care and continuity of care in hospital settings. 
The Clinical Process as a model for documentation in EHR facilitates the 
capturing of clinical information where it emerges in the clinical work 
processes. The model retains in a logical way the clinical relevant relations 
between different information elements that comply with the concept of 
problem-oriented documentation. A comparison between European Pre-standard 
CEN/ENV 13606 and the Danish Conceptual Model reveals different approaches with 
regard to the focus of modelling the EHR information.

Automated coded ambulatory problem lists: evaluation of a vocabulary and a data 
entry tool.

Street, Wellesley, MA 02481, USA. sjwang@partners.org

BACKGROUND: Problem lists are fundamental to electronic medical records (EMRs). 
However, obtaining an appropriate problem list dictionary is difficult, and 
getting users to code their problems at the time of data entry can be 
challenging.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a problem list dictionary and search algorithm for an EMR 
system and evaluate its use.
METHODS: We developed a problem list dictionary and lookup tool and implemented 
it in several EMR systems. A sample of 10,000 problem entries was reviewed from 
each system to assess overall coding rates. We also performed a manual review of 
a subset of entries to determine the appropriateness of coded entries, and to 
assess the reasons other entries were left uncoded.
RESULTS: The overall coding rate varied significantly between different EMR 
implementations (63-79%). Coded entries were virtually always appropriate (99%). 
The most frequent reasons for uncoded entries were due to user interface 
failures (44-45%), insufficient dictionary coverage (20-32%), and non-problem 
entries (10-12%).
CONCLUSION: The problem list dictionary and search algorithm has achieved a good 
coding rate, but the rate is dependent on the specific user interface 
implementation. Problem coding is essential for providing clinical decision 
support, and improving usability should result in better coding rates.

Implications of the problem orientated medical record (POMR) for research using 
electronic GP databases: a comparison of the Doctors Independent Network 
Database (DIN) and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD).

BACKGROUND: The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and Doctor's 
Independent Network Database (DIN), are large electronic primary care databases 
compiled in the UK during the 1990s. They provide a valuable resource for 
epidemiological and health services research. GPRD (based on VAMP) presents 
notes as a series of discrete episodes, whereas DIN is based on a system 
(MEDITEL) that used a Problem Orientated Medical Record (POMR) which links 
prescriptions to diagnostic problems. We have examined the implications for 
research of these different underlying philosophies.
METHODS: Records of 40,183 children from 141 practices in DIN and 76,310 from 
464 practices in GRPD who were followed to age 5 were used to compare the volume 
of recording of prescribing and diagnostic codes in the two databases. To assess 
the importance and additional value of the POMR within DIN, the appropriateness 
of diagnostic linking to skin emollient prescriptions was investigated.
RESULTS: Variation between practices for both the number of days on which 
prescriptions were issued and diagnoses were recorded was marked in both 
databases. Mean number of "prescription days" during the first 5 years of life 
was similar in DIN (19.5) and in GPRD (19.8), but the average number of 
"diagnostic days" was lower in DIN (15.8) than in GPRD (22.9). Adjustment for 
linkage increased the average "diagnostic days" to 23.1 in DIN. 32.7% of 
emollient prescriptions in GPRD appeared with an eczema diagnosis on the same 
day compared to only 19.4% in DIN; however, 86.4% of prescriptions in DIN were 
linked to an earlier eczema diagnosis. More specifically 83% of emollient 
prescriptions appeared under a problem heading of eczema in the 121 practices 
that were using problem headings satisfactorily.
CONCLUSION: Prescribing records in DIN and GPRD are very similar, but the usage 
of diagnostic codes is more parsimonious in DIN because of its POMR structure. 
Period prevalence rates will be underestimated in DIN unless this structure is 
taken into account. The advantage of the POMR is that in 121 of 141 practices 
using problem headings as intended, most prescriptions can be linked to a 
problem heading providing a specific reason for their issue.

BACKGROUND: Quality management in health care services has not been as 
successful as in other industries.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential contribution of an on-line incident reporting 
system (OIRS) and of an electronic patient record (EPR) system to quality 
management in hospitals.
METHODS: The two approaches are being implemented in Osaka University Hospital.
RESULTS: Analysis of the early use of the on-line reporting system indicates 
that this qualitative approach has been effective to avoid adverse medical 
events. The quantitative methodology with the EPR is still in the phase of 
developing.
CONCLUSION: Direct data entry by medical staff and an EPR based on dynamic 
templates and a dynamic problem oriented approach could be useful for building 
clinical data repositories that can support clinical quality management.

Textual content, health problems and diagnostic codes in electronic patient 
records in general practice.

Nilsson G(1), Ahlfeldt H, Strender LE.

Author information:
(1)Department of Clinical Science, Family Medicine Stockholm, Karolinska 
Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. gunnar.nilsson@nlpo.sll.se

OBJECTIVE: To investigate textual content, health problems and diagnostic codes 
in everyday electronic patient records.
DESIGN: Retrospective and observational database study.
SETTING: Primary health care in Stockholm.
SUBJECTS: Twenty randomly selected general practitioners with 20 records each.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency of use of problem-oriented medical records. 
The number of words, problems and diagnostic codes. The completeness and 
correctness of the diagnostic codes.
RESULTS: About 14.5% of 400 studied records were problem-oriented. The mean 
number of words per record was 99.4, and the mean number of problems managed per 
record was 1.2. On average, there were 1.1 diagnostic codes per record and this 
differed widely among GPs and also among the electronic patient record systems. 
The mean number of codes per problem was 0.9, and the proportion of correct 
codes was 97.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: The electronic patient records in general practice in Stockholm 
have an extensive textual content. A vast majority of the problems are coded and 
the completeness and correctness of diagnostic codes are high. It seems that 
problem-oriented electronic patient record systems enforce coding activities. It 
is feasible to establish a database of diagnostic data for research and health 
care planning based on electronic patient records.

Using medication list--problem list mismatches as markers of potential error.

Carpenter JD(1), Gorman PN.

Author information:
(1)Division of Medical Informatics and Outcomes Research, Oregon Health & 
Science University, Portland, OR, USA.

The goal of this project was to specify and develop an algorithm that will check 
for drug and problem list mismatches in an electronic medical record (EMR). The 
algorithm is based on the premise that a patient's problem list and medication 
list should agree, and a mismatch may indicate medication error. Successful 
development of this algorithm could mean detection of some errors, such as 
medication orders entered into a wrong patient record, or drug therapy 
omissions, that are not otherwise detected via automated means. Additionally, 
mismatches may identify opportunities to improve problem list integrity. To 
assess the concept's feasibility, this study compared medications listed in a 
pharmacy information system with findings in an online nursing adult admission 
assessment, serving as a proxy for the problem list. Where drug and problem list 
mismatches were discovered, examination of the patient record confirmed the 
mismatch, and identified any potential causes. Evaluation of the algorithm in 
diabetes treatment indicates that it successfully detects both potential 
medication error and opportunities to improve problem list completeness. This 
algorithm, once fully developed and deployed, could prove a valuable way to 
improve the patient problem list, and could decrease the risk of medication 
error.

Louvain, Brussels, Belgium. declercq@sesa.ucl.ac.be

OBJECTIVE: To overcome some classical limitations of the POMR (Problem-Oriented 
Medical Record), including the management of divergent opinions between health 
professionals, in order to construct a common patient record across multiple 
disciplines in hospital settings and professional networks.
METHODS: Using a complex clinical case, we improved a POMR model previously used 
by GPs in order to translate it into a hospital setting. The enhanced model has 
been assessed through use in various ongoing clinical cases and through extended 
discussion with professional end-users (physicians, nurses, general 
practitioners, and social workers).
RESULTS: The Index concept (flexible structural link) is proposed as a major 
improvement in the construction of a POMR in a shared care environment.
CONCLUSIONS: The Index introduces interesting new perspectives. Following its 
implementation in the Belgian pilot site in the CORINES project, further studies 
remain to be carried out in order to develop a cost/benefit assessment.

Dynamic viewer of medical events in electronic medical record.

Medical record should enable doctors to comprehend the patient's history and 
select suitable medical treatment. In paper based medical records, medical 
events (examination, treatment etc.) are recorded successively, and problem 
oriented recording is difficult to be applied to patients with much information 
and a long history. Consequently it is not easy to understand the patient's 
history from paper based medical records. In order to solve this problem, we 
developed the flow sheet system in our electronic medical record (EMR). To make 
a flow sheet, we analyzed the structure of the medical event data. In this paper 
we introduced the medical event information model for our EMR. Furthermore, we 
clarified the specification of the data presentation on the flow sheet. We 
developed the flow sheet on the basis of these analyses. Because there are 3 
layers in the vertical axis of the flow sheet, many items of the medical event 
can be displayed on the screen. When user clicks the cell, the corresponding 
detail data including images are shown. This system functions to link medical 
event items with a problem, and shows the bundled items on the flow sheet when 
the user selects the problem. We implemented this system in Osaka University 
Hospital. The number of the types of medical events and those of detail events 
in inpatients are 5.0+1.7 (mean+SD) and 60+47, respectively. The medical doctors 
in Osaka University Hospital evaluated this system, and concludes that the flow 
sheet data presentation makes comprehension of the patient's history easier than 
paper based records. As to the function of bundling the items relevant to the 
problem, they feel it is especially useful for patients with chronic disease. 
Thus the flow sheet data presentation in EMR is useful for medical practice.

Ranking of information in the computerized problem-oriented patient record.

Bayegan E(1), Nytrø Ø, Grimsmo A.

Author information:
(1)Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of 
Science and Technology, Trondheim. Norway. bayegan@idi.ntnu.no

We propose a framework for a problem-oriented patient record for general 
practice 1 and defend that the problem-oriented medical record represents an 
intuitive way to organize the patient record. By adding a layer of knowledge to 
the electronic patient record the record system is able to better utilize the 
information stored in the record. If a record system is process aware, having 
knowledge of work processes and is able to distinguish between different 
contexts in use, the system can provide relevant and useful information during 
the handling of patients' medical problems. Information is ranked according to 
its relevancy in a given context by using action patterns - traces. Traces give 
valuable indications of what is going on during the process of patient care. 
Decision frames represents relevant contexts based on the information in the 
record. Both decision frames and traces provide an environment in which more 
optimal medical decisions can be made.

Feedback on prescribing rate combined with problem-oriented pharmacotherapy 
education as a model to improve prescribing behaviour among general 
practitioners.

Author information:

Region, Stockholm County North, Sollentuna, Sweden. gunnar.nilsson@nvso.sil.se

OBJECTIVE: To develop a working model with which prescribing behaviour among 
general practitioners might be influenced.
DESIGN: Intervention based on feedback on prescribing rates and problem-oriented 
educational outreach visits, using educational material and local opinion 
leaders. Randomised study with three parallel intervention groups of general 
practitioners, which also served as controls for each other. The 
pharmacotherapeutic fields chosen were hypertension, peptic ulcer/dyspepsia and 
depression. Prescription data were retrieved from the electronic patient records 
for periods of 1 year before and after the intervention.
SETTING: Six health care centres and three continuing medical education groups 
in Stockholm.
SUBJECTS: Forty general practitioners.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Drug prescribing rates and patterns before and after the 
intervention.
RESULTS: In the hypertension field, desired trends in fractional prescribing 
(favouring diuretics and beta blocking agents) were recorded, with a significant 
(P < 0.05) effect on prescriptions for agents acting on the renin-angiotensin 
system, despite a pre-existing prescribing behaviour already much in line with 
the goals. In the peptic ulcer/dyspepsia field, desired trends were recorded for 
both types of therapies addressed. The fractional prescribing rates for 
proton-pump inhibitors decreased from 61.0% to 52.6% in the intervention arm and 
increased from 68.1% to 76.0% in the control arm (not significant due to low 
power). The depression group focused on better general attention to the disease 
and only minor changes were registered.
CONCLUSION: Feedback of individual prescribing rates, combined with 
problem-oriented educational outreach visits, is a promising model for the 
improvement of prescribing behaviour. Data from the electronic patient record 
were feasible for feedback on prescribing rates.

Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To provide oncology nurses with an overview of computer-based 
patient record (CPR) systems, a key infrastructure requirement in information 
management that is essential to maintaining a scientific basis for health care.
DATA SOURCES: Published articles, research studies, and review articles 
pertaining to CPR systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Progress in hardware development, software applications, and 
interfaces combine to bring us multimedia patient record systems. Many obstacles 
have been overcome as standards have emerged and technologies conform to those 
standards. However, there has been limited success in implementation of such 
systems. Early acceptance of structured data and problem-oriented documentation 
set the framework for charting in the electronic record.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology clinicians and cancer patients alike 
will realize greater efficiencies and increased quality in health care when the 
CPR is fully implemented.

Indianapolis, IN, USA.

Guidelines have a proven ability to improve quality of health care and reduce 
cost, yet, guidelines are not very well deployed at the point of care. This is 
largely due to the impedance mismatch between decision support modules and the 
Electronic Medical Record (EMR.) The Unified Service Action Model (USAM) as part 
of the HL7's Reference Information Model provides a conceptual integration 
between patient data and medical knowledge. The USAM defines one action-oriented 
information structure for patient data, concept definitions, action plans, 
conditionals, and goals. This suggests a new approach to the problem of sharing 
data and knowledge, effectively working around the problem of missing domain 
terminology.

Consultation of medical narratives in the electronic medical record.

huibert.tange@mi.unimaas.nl

This article presents an overview of a research project concerning the 
consultation of medical narratives in the electronic medical record (EMR). It 
describes an analysis of user needs, the design and implementation of a 
prototype EMR system, and the evaluation of the ease of consultation of medical 
narratives when using this system. In a questionnaire survey, 85 hospital 
physicians judged the quality of their paper-based medical record with respect 
to data entry, information retrieval and some other aspects. Participants were 
more positive about the paper medical record than the literature suggests. They 
wished to maintain the flexibility of data entry but indicated the need to 
improve the retrieval of information. A prototype EMR system was developed to 
facilitate the consultation of medical narratives. These parts were divided into 
labeled segments that could be arranged source-oriented and problem-oriented. 
This system was used to evaluate the ease of information retrieval of 24 
internists and 12 residents at a teaching hospital when using free-text medical 
narratives divided at different levels of detail. They solved, without time 
pressure, some predefined problems concerning three voluminous, inpatient case 
records. The participants were randomly allocated to a sequence that was 
balanced by patient case and learning effect. The division of medical narratives 
affected speed, but not completeness of information retrieval. Progress notes 
divided into problem-related segments could be consulted 22% faster than when 
undivided. Medical history and physical examination divided into segments at 
organ-system level could be consulted 13% faster than when divided into separate 
questions and observations. These differences were statistically significant. 
The fastest divisions were also appreciated as the best combination of easy 
searching and best insight in the patient case. The results of our evaluation 
study suggest a trade-off between searching and reading: too much detailed 
segments will delay the consultation of medical narratives. Validation of the 
results in daily practice is recommended.

Modeling information for the electronic medical record (EMR) builds on a century 
of study on information and its relationship to cost and quality improvement. An 
initiative to examine the focus of cost and quality improvement and its 
relationship to information modeling resulted in the development of the Unified 
Service Action Model of healthcare processes, which focuses on the action as the 
center of cost accounting, quality accounting and privacy management. The 
application of this model to the HL7 Reference Information Model produced a 
simplification of the HL7 model at the cost of increased reliance on vocabulary 
terms for actions.

Epidemiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Müchen.

PURPOSE: The computerized patient record must provide patient- and 
problem-oriented access to all relevant patient data for health care 
professionals. The aspects of such systems will be analyzed in the light of the 
radiologist's needs.
METHODS: Integration of the computerized patient record in a hospital 
communication network allows automated data exchange with the ancillary systems. 
Accessibility of electronic textbooks supports case-based learning during 
routine work.
RESULTS: The computerized patient record not only supports routine clinical 
tasks but also training, education and research. The workflow in a hospital can 
be supported by the computerized patient record. Studying the tasks of a 
radiology department shows that both clinicians and radiologists will benefit 
from such a system.
DISCUSSION: Current implementations of clinical computerized workstations offer 
only a fraction of these features. Advances in technology and increasing demands 
at the point of care will promote the development of new information systems of 
this kind.

Clinical care management and workflow by episodes.

This paper describes the implementation of clinically defined episodes of care 
and the introduction of an episode-based summary list of patient problems across 
Mayo Clinic Rochester in 1996 and 1997. Although Mayo's traditional paper-based 
system has always relied on a type of 'episode of care' (called the 
"registration") for patient and history management, a new, more clinically 
relevant definition of episode of care was put into practice in November 1996. 
This was done to improve care management and operational processes and to 
provide a basic construct for the electronic medical record. Also since November 
1996, a computer-generated summary list of patient problems, the "Master Sheet 
Summary Report," organized by episode, has been placed in all patient histories. 
In the third quarter of 1997, the ability to view the episode-based problem 
summary online was made available to the 3000+ EMR-capable workstations deployed 
across the Mayo Rochester campus. In addition, the clinically oriented problem 
summarization process produces an improved basic "package" of clinical 
information expected to lead to improved analytic decision support, outcomes 
analysis and epidemiological research.

How to approach the structuring of the medical record? Towards a model for 
flexible access to free text medical data.

Tange H(1).

The development and dissemination of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) is impeded 
because of several reasons. One of the reasons is considered the 'unruliness' of 
narrative data. In this article it is illustrated how the medical record can be 
structured to make it accessible from different perspectives, without the need 
to change the free text format of the narratives. The organising principles 
behind three existing medical record structures are analysed: the 
source-oriented, problem-oriented and time-oriented medical record. These 
principles are combined in a model of the medical record with four different 
views on medical data: a typological view, a time view, a problem view, and a 
process view. A data model is presented in which each of these views can be 
defined. In the discussion some examples are given of EMRs in which some of 
these views have been applied on coded data.

This paper considers the lessons learnt during the development of the electronic 
medical record for patient care. It is not a definitive history of medical 
records but an assessment of what has been learnt, what has to be learnt and how 
we can move forward. It considers the needs for structured intelligent records 
that help in individual patient care, the need to provide functionality that 
fits with the requirements of the clinician-patient interaction and the need to 
take into account the human factors that affect clinician's uptake of such 
systems. It outlines the issues of free form input as opposed to controlled 
input that have to be resolved.

A standards-based clinical information system for HIV/AIDS.

Stitt FW(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Epidemiology, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL 33101, 
USA.

OBJECTIVE: To create a clinical data repository to interface the Veteran's 
Administration (VA) Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP) and a 
departmental clinical information system for the management of HIV patients. 
This system supports record-keeping, decision-making, reporting, and analysis. 
The database development was designed to overcome two impediments to successful 
implementations of clinical databases: (i) lack of a standard reference data 
model, and; (ii) lack of a universal standard for medical concept 
representation.
BACKGROUND: Health Level Seven (HL7) is a standard protocol that specifies the 
implementation of interfaces between two computer applications (sender and 
receiver) from different vendors or sources of electronic data exchange in the 
health care environment. This eliminates or substantially reduces the custom 
interface programming and program maintenance that would otherwise be required. 
HL7 defines the data to be exchanged, the timing of the interchange, and the 
communication of errors to the application. The formats are generic in nature 
and must be configured to meet the needs of the two applications involved. The 
standard conceptually operates at the seventh level of the ISO model for Open 
Systems Interconnection (OSI). The OSI simply defines the data elements that are 
exchanged as abstract messages, and does not prescribe the exact bit stream of 
the messages that flow over the network. Lower level network software developed 
according to the OSI model may be used to encode and decode the actual bit 
stream. The OSI protocols are not universally implemented and, therefore, a set 
of encoding rules for defining the exact representation of a message must be 
specified. The VA has created an HL7 module to assist DHCP applications in 
exchanging health care information with other applications using the HL7 
protocol. The DHCP HL7 module consists of a set of utility routines and files 
that provide a generic interface to the HL7 protocol for all DHCP applications.
SETTING: The VA's DHCP core modules are in standard use at 169 hospitals, and 
the role of the VA system in health care delivery has been discussed elsewhere. 
This development was performed at the Miami VA Medical Center Special Immunology 
Unit, where a database was created for an HIV patient registry in 1987. Over 
2,300 patient have been entered into a database that supports a problem-oriented 
summary of the patient's clinical record. The interface to the VA DHCP was 
designed and implemented to capture information from the patient treatment file, 
pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, and other modules.
RESULTS: We obtained a suite of programs for implementing the HL7 encoding rules 
from Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, written in ANSI C. This 
toolkit isolates our application programs from the details of the HL7 encoding 
rules, and allows them to deal with abstract messages and the programming level. 
While HL7 has become a standard for healthcare message exchange, SQL (Structured 
Query Language) is the standard for database definition, data manipulation, and 
query. The target database (Stitt F.W. The Problem-Oriented Medical Synopsis: a 
patient-centered clinical information system. Proc 17 SCAMC. 1993:88-93) 
provides clinical workstation functionality. Medical concepts are encoded using 
a preferred terminology derived from over 15 sources that include the Unified 
Medical Language System and SNOMed International ( Stitt F.W. The 
Problem-Oriented Medical Synopsis: coding, indexing, and classification 
sub-model. Proc 18 SCAMC, 1994: in press). The databases were modeled using the 
Information Engineering CASE tools, and were written using relational database 
utilities, including embedded SQL in C (ESQL/C). We linked ESQL/C programs to 
the HL7 toolkit to allow data to be inserted, deleted, or updated, under 
transaction control. A graphical format will be used to display the entity-rel

The uses of the anesthesia record.

Hillis Miller Health Center, Gainesville 32610.

The typical, handwritten anesthesia record of the 1980s does not satisfy its 
many users. The document is used for clinical care by the anesthetist, nurses, 
physicians, and technicians in postanesthesia, intensive, and postoperative 
surgical care units; for historical information by the billing officer, the 
statistician, and the anesthetist in preparation for a future anesthetic; and 
for the review of the quality of care by clinical peers and lawyers. For all of 
these users the typical record contains some to much unnecessary information and 
lacks some to much needed information. Electronic capture, storage, retrieval, 
and formatting of data can generate electronic displays or paper records 
tailored to answer the needs of specific users. The anesthetist in particular 
will benefit from a well-designed system that takes the place of the traditional 
handwritten anesthesia record.

The literature gives evidence of a growing interest in the application of 
computer systems to medicine. It outline the performances, advantages, and 
benefits of these systems, but often does not present the problems that arise in 
the design, realization, and introduction of such systems in health care 
organizations. This paper presents and analyzes some project-oriented and 
organizational problems, giving some possible solutions.

The medical record in general practice. Where art and science meet.

Sigurdsson G.

The human relationship between healer and patient constitutes the basis of 
medical practice. It has been customary for health professionals to make a 
written record of their observations on the interaction. The efforts to produce 
better records consist of structuring them more clearly and extracting certain 
items of information in order to be able to index them like books in a library. 
The electronic computer can solve some of these problems but general 
practitioners have to be aware of the limitations of the computer.

[Use of a computerized problem-oriented record in special ambulatory periodontal 
treatment].

[Article in German]

Grimm WD, Nossek H.

Starting from the development trends of the modern out-patient treatment it is 
required to clearly out-line the objective functions of special out-patient care 
in the periodontology. Of course, the represented function call for more 
comprehensive data acquisition in regard of the individual patient. As a model 
we have worked out a computer-aided problem-oriented record for periodontal care 
which, in a ring hybrid study, is now being tested by 14 different public health 
institutions of the GDR. Our problem-oriented record comprises the following 
parts: a) Patient-machine communication for anamnesis b) Computer-oriented 
medical record c) Automated synoptic presentation of problem epicrisis d) 
Centralized data-pool.
