TI  - Hierarchical Annotation for Building A Suite of Clinical Natural Language 
      Processing Tasks: Progress Note Understanding.
PG  - 5484-5493
AB  - Applying methods in natural language processing on electronic health records 
      (EHR) data is a growing field. Existing corpus and annotation focus on modeling 
      textual features and relation prediction. However, there is a paucity of 
      annotated corpus built to model clinical diagnostic thinking, a process involving 
      text understanding, domain knowledge abstraction and reasoning. This work 
      introduces a hierarchical annotation schema with three stages to address clinical 
      text understanding, clinical reasoning, and summarization. We created an 
      annotated corpus based on an extensive collection of publicly available daily 
      progress notes, a type of EHR documentation that is collected in time series in a 
      problem-oriented format. The conventional format for a progress note follows a 
      Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan heading (SOAP). We also define a new 
      suite of tasks, Progress Note Understanding, with three tasks utilizing the three 
      annotation stages. The novel suite of tasks was designed to train and evaluate 
      future NLP models for clinical text understanding, clinical knowledge 
      representation, inference, and summarization.

TI  - An electronic operation note proforma improves the quality of operation notes in 
      burns surgery.
LID - S0305-4179(22)00100-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.burns.2022.04.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An Operation Note should provide a comprehensive account of the 
      details of a surgical procedure performed and document clinically relevant events 
      which occur throughout the procedure. The Royal College of Surgeons of England, 
      in 2014, updated guidelines on specific criteria to be included in operation 
      notes. Standardisation using procedure-specific operation notes has been shown to 
      significantly improve adherence to these guidelines. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the quality of operation notes in the Irish National Burns Unit before 
      and after the design and implementation of an electronic patient record and the 
      subsequent introduction of an operation template and a burns surgery specific 
      checklist, within the electronic system. METHODS: A 30-point checklist was 
      designed based on existing sources. Operation notes prior to and following the 
      adoption of a electronic-based operation note were analysed, and then reanalysed 
      following the introduction of a procedure-specific operation note. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-three operation notes were included for analysis. An electronic operation 
      record significantly improved the quality of documentation within our unit. The 
      subsequent procedure specific operation note had a significant improvement across 
      all areas and achieved 100% compliance in many categories. CONCLUSIONS: The use 
      of an electronic patient record to document a patient's procedure has been shown 
      to significantly improve the quality of documentation. One could expect this to 
      result in an improved patient hand-over and subsequent episode of care. We 
      highlight a number of initial pit-falls that others may avoid in their 
      implementation of a digital record.

      Keyword-Based Summarization of Nursing Care Episodes.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI220154 [doi]
AB  - Tools to automate the summarization of nursing entries in electronic health 
      records (EHR) have the potential to support healthcare professionals to obtain a 
      rapid overview of a patient's situation when time is limited. This study explores 
      a keyword-based text summarization method for the nursing text that is based on 
      machine learning model explainability for text classification models. This study 
      aims to extract keywords and phrases that provide an intuitive overview of the 
      content in multiple nursing entries in EHRs written during individual patients' 
      care episodes. The proposed keyword extraction method is used to generate keyword 
      summaries from 40 patients' care episodes and its performance is compared to a 
      baseline method based on word embeddings combined with the PageRank method. The 
      two methods were assessed with manual evaluation by three domain experts. The 
      results indicate that it is possible to generate representative keyword summaries 
      from nursing entries in EHRs and our method outperformed the baseline method.

      Patient Encounter Information.
PG  - 158-162
LID - 10.3233/SHTI220052 [doi]
AB  - Electronic patient charts are essential for follow-up and multi-disciplinary 
      care, but either take up an exorbitant amount of time during the patient 
      encounter using a key-stroke entry system, or suffer from poor recall when made 
      long after the encounter. Transcribing in-situ, natural dictations by the 
      clinician, recorded during the encounter, with minimal workflow impact, is a 
      promising solution. However, human transcription requires significant manual 
      resources, whereas automated transcription currently lacks the accuracy for 
      specialized clinical language. Our ultimate goal is to automate clinical 
      transcription, particularly for Emergency Departments, with as an end-result a 
      structured SOAP report. Towards this goal, we present the Adaptive Clinical 
      Transcription System (ACTS). We compare the accuracy and processing times of 
      state-of-the-art speech recognition tools, studying the feasibility of 
      streaming-style dynamic transcription and opportunities of incremental learning.

PG  - 15589447221082163
LID - 10.1177/15589447221082163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Orthopaedic Minimal Data Set (OrthoMiDaS) Episode of care (OME) 
      is a prospectively collected database enabling capture of patient and 
      surgeon-reported data in a more efficient, comprehensive, and dependable manner 
      than electronic medical record (EMR) review. We aimed to assess and validate the 
      OME as a data capture tool for carpometacarpal (CMC) arthroplasty compared to 
      traditional EMR-based review. Specifically, we aimed to: (1) compare the 
      completeness of the OME versus EMR data; and (2) evaluate the extent of agreement 
      between the OME and EMR data-based datasets for carpometacarpal (CMC) 
      arthroplasty. METHODS: The first 100 thumb CMC arthroplasties after OME inception 
      (Febuary, 2015) were included. Blinded EMR-based review of the same cases was 
      performedfor 48 perioperative variables and compared to their OME-sourced 
      counterparts. Outcomes included completion rates and agreement measures in OME 
      versus EMR-based control datasets. RESULTS: The OME demonstrated superior 
      completion rates compared to EMR-based retrospective review. There was high 
      agreement between both datasets where 75.6% (34/45) had an agreement proportion 
      of >0.90% and 82.2% (37/45) had an agreement proportion of >0.80. Over 40% of the 
      variables had almost perfect to substantial agreement (κ > 0.60). Among the 6 
      variables demonstrating poor agreement, the surgeon-inputted OME values were more 
      accurate than the EMR-based review control. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the 
      use of the OME for CMC arthroplasty by illustrating that it is reliably able to 
      match or supersede traditional chart review for data collection; thereby offering 
      a high-quality tool for future CMC arthroplasty studies.

TI  - Reducing Physicians' Cognitive Load During Chart Review: A Problem-Oriented 
      Summary of the Patient Electronic Record.
PG  - 763-772
AB  - Overabundance of information within electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted 
      in a need for automated systems to mitigate the cognitive burden on physicians 
      utilizing today's EHR systems. We present ProSPER, a Problem-oriented Summary of 
      the Patient Electronic Record that displays a patient summary centered around an 
      auto-generated problem list and disease-specific views for chronic conditions. 
      ProSPER was developed using 1,500 longitudinal patient records from two large 
      multi-specialty medical groups in the United States, and leverages multiple 
      natural language processing (NLP) components targeting various fundamental (e.g. 
      syntactic analysis), clinical (e.g. adverse drug event extraction) and 
      summarizing (e.g. problem list generation) tasks. We report evaluation results 
      for each component and discuss how specific components address existing physician 
      challenges in reviewing EHR data. This work demonstrates the need to leverage 
      holistic information in EHRs to build a comprehensive summarization application, 
      and the potential for NLP-based applications to support physicians and improve 
      clinical care.

TI  - Cost Drivers of Elective Colon and Rectal Surgery: A Retrospective Cohort 
      Analysis.
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000002267 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal surgery is expensive. Few studies have examined 
      complications as an economic cost driver, and there is little evidence comparing 
      multiple cost drivers of colorectal surgery to determine the most effective means 
      of reducing total cost. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the effects of 
      surgical techniques, use of enhanced recovery protocols, and presence or absence 
      of complications on total cost of hospitalization for elective colorectal 
      surgery. DESIGN: A retrospective, cohort analysis utilizing data from 2011-2018 
      was performed. The primary endpoint was mean cost-per-hospitalization. Cost was 
      compared between patients who experienced: minimally invasive versus open 
      surgeries, enhanced recovery after surgery protocols versus not, and 
      complications versus not. DATA SOURCE: The hospital's financial and accounting 
      database and electronic medical record were queried to capture data. SETTINGS: 
      This study was conducted at a university-affiliated teaching hospital in the 
      North East United States. PATIENTS: Adult patients having elective colorectal 
      surgery were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome for this study 
      was mean cost per hospitalization calculated using inpatient cost based on the 
      total cost of the episode of care. RESULTS: A total of 1,039 patients met 
      criteria for inclusion. The average cost of all hospitalizations was $19,801. 
      Multivariate analysis demonstrated that enhanced recovery protocols substantially 
      lowered the cost of care by $6,392 (p = 0.001) while complications increased cost 
      by $16,780 per episode (p < 0.001). When complications did occur, enhanced 
      recovery protocols reduced cost by $17,963 (p = 0.010). LIMITATIONS: This is a 
      retrospective cohort study performed at a single institution and has inherent 
      limitations including confounding and selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: For elective 
      colorectal surgery, complications are associated with significantly increased 
      costs. Avoiding complications should be a priority to reduce costs. Enhanced 
      recovery protocols are associated with significantly reduce costs. Surgeons 
      should focus future research efforts on improving protocols and processes that 
      decrease post-operative complications to improve patient outcomes and to decrease 
      costs associated with elective colorectal hospitalizations. See Video Abstract at

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Balgrist University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland, is an 
      academic hospital focused on musculoskeletal disorders. An integrated 
      chiropractic medicine clinic provides chiropractic care to a broad patient 
      population. This health services research study aims to advance understanding of 
      chiropractic healthcare service for quality assurance and healthcare quality 
      improvement. METHODS: We performed an observational clinical cohort study at the 
      Balgrist chiropractic medicine outpatient clinic in 2019. The records of all 
      patients with initial visits or returning initial visits (> 3 months since last 
      visit) and their subsequent visits from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, 
      were used to create the study dataset. Data collected included demographic 
      characteristics, diagnoses, imaging data, conservative treatments, surgeries, and 
      other clinical care data. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data. 
      RESULTS: 1844 distinct patients (52% female, mean age 48 ± 17 years) were 
      eligible and included in the study. 1742 patients had a single initial visit, 101 
      had 2 initial visits, and 1 patient had 3 initial visits during the study period 
      (total of 1947 initial visit records). The most common main diagnoses were low 
      back pain (42%; 95% CI 40-46%), neck pain (22%; 20-24%), and thoracic pain (8%; 
      7-9%). 32% of patients presented with acute (< 4 weeks) symptoms, 11% subacute 
      (4-12 weeks), and 57% chronic (> 12 weeks). Patients had a median of 5 
      chiropractic visits during their episode of care within a median of 28 days 
      duration. Only 49% (95% CI 47-52%) of patient records had a clinical outcome that 
      was extractable from routine clinical documentation in the hospital information 
      system. CONCLUSION: This health services study provides an initial understanding 
      of patient characteristics and healthcare delivered in a Swiss academic hospital 
      chiropractic outpatient setting and areas for improved clinical data quality 
      assurance. A more concerted effort to systematically collect patient reported 
      outcome measures would be a worthwhile healthcare quality improvement initiative.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large prospective institutional data provide the opportunity to 
      conduct level II and III studies using robust methodologies and adequately 
      powered sample-sizes, while circumventing limitations of retrospective databases. 
      We aimed to validate a prospective data collection tool, the Orthopaedic Minimal 
      Data Set Episode of Care (OME), implemented at a tertiary North American health 
      care system for distal radial fracture (DRF) open reduction and internal fixation 
      (ORIF). METHODS: The first 100 DRF ORIFs performed after OME inception (February 
      2015) were selected for this validation study. A blinded review of the operative 
      notes and charts was performed, and extracted data of 75 perioperative DRF ORIF 
      procedure variables were compared with OME collected data for agreement. Outcomes 
      included completion rates and agreement measures in OME versus e﻿lectronic 
      medical record (EMR)-based control datasets. Data counts were evaluated using raw 
      percentages and McNemar tests. Cohen (κ) and concordance correlation coefficient 
      analyzed categorical and numerical variable agreement, respectively. RESULTS: 
      Overall, OME demonstrated superior completion and agreement parameters versus 
      EMR-based retrospective review. Nine data points (12.0%) demonstrated 
      significantly higher completion rates within the OME dataset (P < .05, each), and 
      88% (66/75) of captured variables demonstrated similar completion rates. Up to 
      80.0% (60/75) of variables either demonstrated an agreement proportion of ≥0.90 
      or were solely reported in the OME. Of 33 variables eligible for agreement 
      analyses, 36.4% (12/33) demonstrated almost perfect agreement (κ > 0.80), and 
      63.6% (21/33) exhibited almost perfect or substantial agreement (κ > 0.60). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The OME is a valid and accurate prospective data collection tool for 
      DRF ORIF that is reliably able to match or supersede traditional retrospective 
      chart review. Future investigations could use this tool for large-scale analyses 
      investigating peri/intraoperative DRF ORIF variables.

      machine learning: a systematic review.
PG  - 559-575
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocab236 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of using unstructured clinical text in 
      machine learning (ML) for prediction, early detection, and identification of 
      sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, ACM DL, dblp, and IEEE Xplore 
      databases were searched. Articles utilizing clinical text for ML or natural 
      language processing (NLP) to detect, identify, recognize, diagnose, or predict 
      the onset, development, progress, or prognosis of systemic inflammatory response 
      syndrome, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock were included. Sepsis 
      definition, dataset, types of data, ML models, NLP techniques, and evaluation 
      metrics were extracted. RESULTS: The clinical text used in models include 
      narrative notes written by nurses, physicians, and specialists in varying 
      situations. This is often combined with common structured data such as 
      demographics, vital signs, laboratory data, and medications. Area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) comparison of ML methods showed 
      that utilizing both text and structured data predicts sepsis earlier and more 
      accurately than structured data alone. No meta-analysis was performed because of 
      incomparable measurements among the 9 included studies. DISCUSSION: Studies 
      focused on sepsis identification or early detection before onset; no studies used 
      patient histories beyond the current episode of care to predict sepsis. Sepsis 
      definition affects reporting methods, outcomes, and results. Many methods rely on 
      continuous vital sign measurements in intensive care, making them not easily 
      transferable to general ward units. CONCLUSIONS: Approaches were heterogeneous, 
      but studies showed that utilizing both unstructured text and structured data in 
      ML can improve identification and early detection of sepsis.

AB  - Medical documentation arose as individual case reports written for teaching 
      purposes. Documentation for patient care later occurred in physicians' personal 
      daybooks and only evolved into the individual patient record in the early 20th 
      century. Dr. Lawrence Weed improved the utility of the patient record by 
      introducing a problem-oriented/subject-object-assessment-plan structure and he 
      and other innovators transformed the patient record into electronic form. 
      Pediatricians built on these innovations to create a child health electronic 
      health record (EHR) for primary care. An American Academy of Pediatrics task 
      force formally specified the child-specific needs of the EHR, but much work 
      remains to integrate the EHR into the pediatric primary care of the future.

TI  - Can Reducing Implant Costs Increase Revenue for Surgically Treated Ankle 
      Fractures: Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing for 1-Year Episode of Care.
PG  - 19386400211062456
LID - 10.1177/19386400211062456 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether decision-making 
      regarding implant selection affects the reimbursement margins for the surgical 
      fixation of ankle fractures. METHODS: All ankle fractures treated between 2010 
      and 2017 within a single-insurer database were identified via Current Procedural 
      Terminology codes by review of electronic medical record. Implant cost was 
      determined via the implant record cross-referenced with the single contract 
      institutional charge master database. The Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing 
      (TDABC) technique was used to determine the costs of care during all activities 
      throughout the 1-year episode of care. Statistical analysis consisted of multiple 
      linear regression and goodness-of-fit analyses. RESULTS: In all, 249 patients met 
      inclusion criteria. Implant costs ranged from $173 to $3944, averaging $1342 ± 
      $751. The TDABC-estimated cost of care ranged from $1416 to $9185, averaging 
      $3869 ± $1384. Finally, the total reimbursed cost of care ranged between $1335 
      and $65 645, averaging $13 954 ± $9445. The implant costs occupied an estimated 
      34.7% of the TDABC-estimated cost of care per surgical encounter. Implant cost, 
      as a percentage of the overall TDABC, was estimated as 36.2% in the inpatient 
      setting and 33% in the outpatient setting, which was the second highest 
      percentage behind surgical costs in both settings. We found a significant 
      increase in net revenue of $1.93 for each dollar saved on implants in the 
      outpatient setting, whereas the increase in net revenue per dollar saved of $1.03 
      approached significance in the inpatient setting. CONCLUSION: There is a direct 
      relationship between intraoperative decision-making, as evidenced by implant 
      choices, and the revenue generated by surgical fixation of ankle fractures. 
      Intraoperative decision-making that is cognitive of implant cost can facilitate 
      adoption of institutional cost containment measures and prompt increased 
      healthcare value. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III: Retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians spend large amounts of their workday using electronic 
      medical records (EMRs). Poorly designed documentation systems contribute to the 
      proliferation of out-of-date information, increased time spent on medical 
      records, clinician burnout, and medical errors. Beyond software interfaces, 
      examining the underlying paradigms and organizational structures for clinical 
      information may provide insights into ways to improve documentation systems. In 
      particular, our attachment to the note as the major organizational unit for 
      storing unstructured medical data may be a cause of many of the problems with 
      modern clinical documentation. Notes, as currently understood, systematically 
      incentivize information duplication and information scattering, both within a 
      single clinician's notes over time and across multiple clinicians' notes. 
      Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore alternative paradigms for unstructured 
      data organization. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to demonstrate the 
      feasibility of building an EMR that does not use notes as the core organizational 
      unit for unstructured data and which is designed specifically to disincentivize 
      information duplication and information scattering. METHODS: We used specific 
      design principles to minimize the incentive for users to duplicate and scatter 
      information. By default, the majority of a patient's medical history remains the 
      same over time, so users should not have to redocument that information. 
      Clinicians on different teams or services mostly share the same medical 
      information, so all data should be collaboratively shared across teams and 
      services (while still allowing for disagreement and nuance). In all cases where a 
      clinician must state that information has remained the same, they should be able 
      to attest to the information without redocumenting it. We designed and built a 
      web-based EMR based on these design principles. RESULTS: We built a medical 
      documentation system that does not use notes and instead treats the chart as a 
      single, dynamically updating, and fully collaborative workspace. All information 
      is organized by clinical topic or problem. Version history functionality is used 
      to enable granular tracking of changes over time. Our system is highly 
      customizable to individual workflows and enables each individual user to decide 
      which data should be structured and which should be unstructured, enabling 
      individuals to leverage the advantages of structured templating and clinical 
      decision support as desired without requiring programming knowledge. The system 
      is designed to facilitate real-time, fully collaborative documentation and 
      communication among multiple clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the 
      feasibility of building a non-note-based, fully collaborative EMR system. Our 
      attachment to the note as the only possible atomic unit of unstructured medical 
      data should be reevaluated, and alternative models should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the creation of the problem-oriented medical record, the 
      building of problem lists has been the focus of many studies. To date, this issue 
      is not well resolved, and building an appropriate contextualized problem list is 
      still a challenge. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to present the process of building 
      a shared multipurpose common problem list at the Geneva University Hospitals. 
      This list aims to bridge the gap between clinicians' language expressed in free 
      text and secondary uses requiring structured information. METHODS: We focused on 
      the needs of clinicians by building a list of uniquely identified expressions to 
      support their daily activities. In the second stage, these expressions were 
      connected to additional information to build a complex graph of information. A 
      list of 45,946 expressions manually extracted from clinical documents was 
      manually curated and encoded in multiple semantic dimensions, such as 
      International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision; International 
      Classification of Primary Care 2nd edition; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine 
      Clinical Terms; or dimensions dictated by specific usages, such as identifying 
      expressions specific to a domain, a gender, or an intervention. The list was 
      progressively deployed for clinicians with an iterative process of quality 
      control, maintenance, and improvements, including the addition of new expressions 
      or dimensions for specific needs. The problem management of the electronic health 
      record allowed the measurement and correction of encoding based on real-world 
      use. RESULTS: The list was deployed in production in January 2017 and was 
      regularly updated and deployed in new divisions of the hospital. Over 4 years, 
      684,102 problems were created using the list. The proportion of free-text entries 
      decreased progressively from 37.47% (8321/22,206) in December 2017 to 18.38% 
      (4547/24,738) in December 2020. In the last version of the list, over 14 
      dimensions were mapped to expressions, among which 5 were international 
      classifications and 8 were other classifications for specific uses. The list 
      became a central axis in the electronic health record, being used for many 
      different purposes linked to care, such as surgical planning or emergency wards, 
      or in research, for various predictions using machine learning techniques. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study breaks with common approaches primarily by focusing on 
      real clinicians' language when expressing patients' problems and secondarily by 
      mapping whatever is required, including controlled vocabularies to answer 
      specific needs. This approach improves the quality of the expression of patients' 
      problems while allowing the building of as many structured dimensions as needed 
      to convey semantics according to specific contexts. The method is shown to be 
      scalable, sustainable, and efficient at hiding the complexity of semantics or the 
      burden of constraint-structured problem list entry for clinicians. Ongoing work 
      is analyzing the impact of this approach on how clinicians express patients' 
      problems.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state of problem 
      list maintenance at an academic medical center. SUMMARY: We included problem list 
      data for patients who had at least 2 face-to-face encounters at Vanderbilt 
      University Medical Center or its clinics between January 1, 2018, and December 
      31, 2019. We used the frequency of problem list additions, resolutions, 
      deletions, duplicate problems (exact and SNOMED CT duplicates), inconsistencies 
      (contradicting stages of disease state), and items that could be documented 
      elsewhere in the electronic health record as surrogate markers of problem list 
      maintenance. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the results. A total 
      of 546,510 patients met inclusion criteria. There were 3,762 (0.7%) patients who 
      had the exact same active problem listed more than once. SNOMED CT code 
      duplications occurred in the records for 56,399 (10.5%) patients. Of the patients 
      with asthma, 2.5% (223/8,779) had contradicting asthma stages active on their 
      problem list, and 6.4% (950/14,950) of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
      had contradicting CKD stages. In addition, 17,205 (3.1%) patients had 20,365 
      active family history problems and 39,464 (7.2%) patients had an allergy 
      documented on their problem list. On average, there were 43.7 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 14-73.4) additions, 8.7 (95% CI, 0.1-17.4) resolutions, and 2.1 
      (95% CI, 0-4.6) deletions of problems per 100 face-to-face encounters, inpatient 
      or outpatient. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests areas for improvement for problem 
      list maintenance. Further studies into semantic duplication and clinical decision 
      support tools to encourage problem list maintenance and deduplication are needed.

LID - e2125173
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite billions spent in public investment, electronic health 
      records (EHRs) have not delivered on the promise of large quality and safety 
      improvement. Simultaneously, there is debate on whether public quality reporting 
      is a useful tool to incentivize quality improvement. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      whether publicly reported feedback was associated with hospital improvement in an 
      evaluation of medication-related clinical decision support (CDS) safety 
      performance. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nonrandomized controlled 
      trial included US hospitals that participated in the Computerized Provider Order 
      Entry (CPOE) Evaluation Tool in the Leapfrog Hospital Survey, a national quality 
      reporting program that evaluates safety performance of hospital CDS using 
      simulated orders and patients, in 2017 to 2018. A sharp regression discontinuity 
      design was used to identify the association of receiving negative feedback with 
      hospital performance improvement in the subsequent year. Data were analyzed from 
      January through September 2020. EXPOSURES: Publicly reported quality feedback. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was improvement from 2017 to 2018 on 
      the Leapfrog CPOE Evaluation Tool, using regression discontinuity model estimates 
      of the association of receiving negative publicly reported feedback with quality 
      improvement. RESULTS: A total of 1183 hospitals were included, with a mean (SD) 
      CPOE score of 59.3% (16.3%) at baseline. Hospitals receiving negative feedback 
      improved 8.44 (95% CI, 0.09 to 16.80) percentage points more in the subsequent 
      year compared with hospitals that received positive feedback on the same 
      evaluation. This change was driven by differences in improvement in basic CDS 
      capabilities (β = 8.71 [95%CI, 1.67 to 18.73]) rather than advanced CDS (β = 6.15 
      [95% CI, -9.11 to 26.83]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nonrandomized 
      controlled trial, publicly reported feedback was associated with quality 
      improvement, suggesting targeted measurement and reporting of process quality may 
      be an effective policy lever to encourage improvement in specific areas. Clinical 
      decision support represents an important tool in ensuring patient safety and 
      decreasing adverse drug events, especially for complex patients and those with 
      multiple chronic conditions who often receive several different drugs during an 
      episode of care.

      Netherlands.
PG  - 709-723
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2021.04.200609 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Structuring patient and practice data into episodes formed the 
      foundation of the earliest evidence base of family medicine. We aim to make 
      patients' narratives part of the evidence base for family medicine by 
      incorporating coded and structured information on the patient's reason to visit 
      the family physician (FP) and adding the patient's personal and contextual 
      characteristics to routine registration data. This documentation allows studies 
      of relations between morbidity and elements of the patient story, providing more 
      insight into the range of problems presented to primary care and in the 
      patient-centeredness applied by FPs. METHODS: The Dutch Practice-Based Research 
      Network (PBRN), named FaMe-Net, is the world's oldest PBRN. Seven Dutch family 
      practices provide regular primary care and participate in the PBRN. It contains 
      all morbidity data of the approximately 40,000 listed patients (308,000 
      patient-years and 2.2 million encounters from 2005 until 2019). All information 
      belonging to 1 health problem is ordered in 1 episode. Morbidity (diagnoses), 
      reasons for encounter (RFE), and interventions are coded according to the 
      International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2). Registration occurs within 
      the electronic health record (EHR), specially designed to facilitate the 
      extensive registration for the PBRN. Since 2016, the network expanded routine 
      registration with the duration of symptoms and coded personal and contextual 
      characteristics (eg, country of birth, level of education, family history, 
      traumatic events) obtained through the self-reported 'context survey' of listed 
      patients. These data are added to the EHR. Registered data are extracted from the 
      EHR and processed for scientific research.We present data on the differences in 
      RFEs of the most prominent symptoms of COVID-19 between 2019 and 2020; the 
      relation between the diagnosis of pneumonia and presentation of the symptom 
      'cough,' and how personal determinants influence the chances of final diagnoses. 
      Lastly, we show the relation of self-reported abuse with patient's contact 
      frequency and psychosocial problems. RESULTS: Prompt introduction of registration 
      rules brought insight into COVID-19-related symptoms early in the pandemic. In 
      March 2020, symptoms related to COVID-19 were presented more often than in March 
      2019. Chronic conditions and prevention showed a collapsing contact frequency. 
      Telephone, email, and video consultations increased from 31% to 53%.Episodes of 
      pneumonia most frequently started with the RFE 'cough.' A combination of 'cough' 
      and 'fever' as RFE increases the likelihood of pneumonia, as does cough in the 
      presence of comorbid COPD among older men. The prevalence of pneumonia is higher 
      among patients with low socioeconomic status. DISCUSSION: The Dutch PBRN FaMe-Net 
      has started to add elements of patients' narratives and context to decades of 
      morbidity registration, creating options for a scientific approach to primary 
      care's core values. Assumptions of 'pre/post chances' of the final diagnosis, 
      already existing implicitly in FPs minds, can be elaborated and quantified by 
      investigating the associations between multiple registered variables, including 
      parts of patients' 'stories.' This way, we aim to make visible what is 
      intuitively already known by FPs.

TI  - Keratoconjunctivitis sicca in dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK: an 
      epidemiological study.
PG  - 636-645
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13382 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency and breed-related risk factors for 
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) in dogs under UK primary veterinary care. 
      METHODS: Analysis of cohort electronic patient record data through the VetCompass 
      Programme. Risk factor analysis used multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: 
      There were 1456 KCS cases overall from 363,898 dogs [prevalence 0.40%, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.42] and 430 incident cases during 2013 (1-year 
      incidence risk 0.12%, 95% CI 0.11-0.13). Compared with crossbreds, breeds with 
      the highest odds ratio (aOR) for KCS included American cocker spaniel (aOR 52.33: 
      95% CI 30.65-89.37), English bulldog (aOR 37.95: 95% CI 26.54-54.28), pug (aOR 
      22.09: 95% CI 15.15-32.2) and Lhasa apso (aOR 21.58: 95% CI 16.29-28.57). 
      Conversely, Labrador retrievers (aOR 0.23: 95% CI 0.1-0.52) and border collie 
      (aOR 0.30: 95% CI 0.11-0.82) had reduced odds. Brachycephalic dogs had 3.63 (95% 
      CI 3.24-4.07) times odds compared to mesocephalics. Spaniels had 3.03 (95% CI 
      2.69-3.40) times odds compared to non-spaniels. Dogs weighing at or above the 
      mean bodyweight for breed/sex had 1.25 (95% CI 1.12-1.39) times odds compared to 
      body weights below. Advancing age was strongly associated with increased odds. 
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative tear tests are recommended within yearly 
      health examinations for breeds with evidence of predisposition to KCS and might 
      also be considered in the future within eye testing for breeding in predisposed 
      breeds. Breed predisposition to KCS suggests that breeding strategies could aim 
      to reduce extremes of facial conformation.

TI  - Usual Medical Care for Patellofemoral Pain Does Not Usually Involve Much Care: 
      2-Year Follow-up in the Military Health System.
PG  - 305-313
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2021.10076 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the most common type and timing of interventions used to 
      initially manage patellofemoral pain (PFP), and whether exercise therapy as an 
      initial treatment was associated with a decreased likelihood of recurrence of 
      PFP. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. METHODS: Active-duty military service members 
      (n = 74 408) aged 18 to 50 years and diagnosed with PFP between 2010 and 2011 
      were included. We identified the type and timing of interventions from electronic 
      medical records and insurance payer claims, and studied the influence of early 
      exercise therapy use on injury recurrence rates. RESULTS: In this cohort of 
      patients with PFP, 62.3% (n = 46 338) sought no additional care after the initial 
      visit. The most common initial pharmacological interventions were nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs (4.1%), corticosteroid injections (0.4%), and muscle 
      relaxers (0.3%). The most common initial nonpharmacological treatments were 
      exercise therapy (7.6%), passive modalities (eg, hot packs, electrical 
      stimulation, ultrasound; 0.6%), and manual therapy (joint manipulation and 
      mobilization; 0.5%). Common specialty referrals were to physical therapy (3.3%) 
      and orthopaedic providers (0.8%). If patients received at least 6 exercise 
      therapy visits during the initial episode of care, they were less likely to have 
      a recurrence of knee pain (odds ratio = 0.46; 95% confidence interval: 0.42, 
      0.49). CONCLUSION: Two in every 3 patients did not seek additional care after PFP 
      diagnosis. For those who sought additional care, exercise therapy was the most 
      common intervention, and higher doses of exercise therapy were associated with a 
      reduced likelihood of having a recurrent episode of knee pain. J Orthop Sports

PG  - 563-572
AB  - Clinicians from different care settings can distort the problem list from 
      conveying a patient's actual health status, affecting quality and patient safety. 
      To measure this effect, a reference standard was built to derive a problem-list 
      based model. Real-world problem lists were used to derive an ideal categorization 
      cutoff score. The model was tested against patient records to categorize problem 
      lists as either having longitudinal inconsistencies or not. The model was able to 
      successfully categorize these events with ~87% accuracy, ~83% sensitivity, and 
      ~89% specificity. This new model can be used to quantify intervention effects, 
      can be reported in problem list studies, and can be used to measure problem list 
      changes based on policy, workflow, or system changes.

TI  - Improving the Utility of Tobacco-Related Problem List Entries Using Natural 
      Language Processing.
PG  - 534-543
AB  - We present findings on using natural language processing to classify 
      tobacco-related entries from problem lists found within patient's electronic 
      health records. Problem lists describe health-related issues recorded during a 
      patient's medical visit; these problems are typically followed up upon during 
      subsequent visits and are updated for relevance or accuracy. The mechanics of 
      problem lists vary across different electronic health record systems. In general, 
      they either manifest as pre-generated generic problems that may be selected from 
      a master list or as text boxes where a healthcare professional may enter free 
      text describing the problem. Using commonly-available natural language processing 
      tools, we classified tobacco-related problems into three classes: active-user, 
      former-user, and non-user; we further demonstrate that rule-based post-processing 
      may significantly increase precision in identifying these classes (+32%, +22%, 
      +35% respectively). We used these classes to generate tobacco time-spans that 
      reconstruct a patient's tobacco-use history and better support secondary data 
      analysis. We bundle this as an open-source toolkit with flow visualizations 
      indicating how patient tobacco-related behavior changes longitudinally, which can 
      also capture and visualize contradicting information such as smokers being 
      flagged as having never smoked.

PG  - 14604582211007534
LID - 10.1177/14604582211007534 [doi]
AB  - This cross sectional study examines how patient characteristics, doctor 
      characteristics, and doctors' education and attitudes affect the extent to which 
      doctors link progress notes to clinical problems. The independent effects of 
      patient characteristics on the linking of notes was examined with a mixed model 
      logistic regression. The effects of doctor characteristics and doctors' education 
      and attitudes on the link ratio was analyzed with univariate analysis of 
      variance. A survey was used to obtain arguments and attitudes on linking notes. 
      For "patient characteristics", the odds of linking increased with an increase in 
      the number of problems or hospital days, decreased, with an increase in the 
      number of involved doctors, medical specialties or the number of notes. For 
      "doctor characteristics", the link ratio increased with more work experience. For 
      "doctors' education and attitudes", the link ratio increased with more 
      familiarity in linking notes and belief in the added value of problem oriented 
      charting. "Overview" was the most cited reason for linking; "I don't know how" 
      the most cited reason for not linking. There is a huge variation within and 
      between all disciplines. Important arguments, for and against, are found. 
      Recommendations for policymakers and medical leadership are given to maximize the 
      benefits.

TI  - Contextual property detection in Dutch diagnosis descriptions for uncertainty, 
      laterality and temporality.
PG  - 120

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate, coded problem lists are valuable for data reuse, including 
      clinical decision support and research. However, healthcare providers frequently 
      modify coded diagnoses by including or removing common contextual properties in 
      free-text diagnosis descriptions: uncertainty (suspected glaucoma), laterality 
      (left glaucoma) and temporality (glaucoma 2002). These contextual properties 
      could cause a difference in meaning between underlying diagnosis codes and 
      modified descriptions, inhibiting data reuse. We therefore aimed to develop and 
      evaluate an algorithm to identify these contextual properties. METHODS: A 
      rule-based algorithm called UnLaTem (Uncertainty, Laterality, Temporality) was 
      developed using a single-center dataset, including 288,935 diagnosis 
      descriptions, of which 73,280 (25.4%) were modified by healthcare providers. 
      Internal validation of the algorithm was conducted with an independent sample of 
      980 unique records. A second validation of the algorithm was conducted with 996 
      records from a Dutch multicenter dataset including 175,210 modified descriptions 
      of five hospitals. Two researchers independently annotated the two validation 
      samples. Performance of the algorithm was determined using means of the recall 
      and precision of the validation samples. The algorithm was applied to the 
      multicenter dataset to determine the actual prevalence of the contextual 
      properties within the modified descriptions per specialty. RESULTS: For the 
      single-center dataset recall (and precision) for removal of uncertainty, 
      uncertainty, laterality and temporality respectively were 100 (60.0), 99.1 
      (89.9), 100 (97.3) and 97.6 (97.6). For the multicenter dataset for removal of 
      uncertainty, uncertainty, laterality and temporality it was 57.1 (88.9), 86.3 
      (88.9), 99.7 (93.5) and 96.8 (90.1). Within the modified descriptions of the 
      multicenter dataset, 1.3% contained removal of uncertainty, 9.9% uncertainty, 
      31.4% laterality and 9.8% temporality. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a 
      rule-based algorithm named UnLaTem to identify contextual properties in Dutch 
      modified diagnosis descriptions. UnLaTem could be extended with more trigger 
      terms, new rules and the recognition of term order to increase the performance 
      even further. The algorithm's rules are available as additional file 2. 
      Implementing UnLaTem in Dutch hospital systems can improve precision of 
      information retrieval and extraction from diagnosis descriptions, which can be 
      used for data reuse purposes such as decision support and research.

TI  - Hospital at Home services: An inventory of fee-for-service payments to inform 
      Medicare reimbursement.
PG  - 1982-1992
LID - 10.1111/jgs.17140 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital at Home (HaH) is a growing model of care with proven patient 
      benefits. However, for the types of services required to provide an episode of 
      HaH, full Medicare reimbursement is traditionally paid only if care is provided 
      in inpatient facilities. DESIGN: This project identifies HaH services that could 
      be reimbursable under Medicare to inform episodic care within fee-for-service 
      (FFS) Medicare. SETTING: All data are derived from acute services provided from 
      the Mount Sinai HaH program between 2014 and 2017 as part of a Center for 
      Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) demonstration program. PARTICIPANTS: The 
      sample was limited to patients with one of the following five admitting 
      diagnoses: urinary tract infection (n = 70), pneumonia (n = 60), cellulitis 
      (n = 45), heart failure (n = 37), and chronic lung disease (n = 24) for a total 
      of 236 acute episodes. MEASUREMENTS: HaH services were inventoried from three 
      sources: electronic medical records, Medicare billing and itemized vendor 
      billing. For each admitting diagnosis, four reimbursement scenarios were 
      evaluated: (1) FFS Medicare without a home health episode, (2) FFS Medicare with 
      a home health episode, (3) two-sided risk ACO with a home health episode, and (4) 
      two-sided risk ACO without a home health episode. RESULTS: Across diagnoses, 
      there were 1.5-1.9 MD visits and 1.5-2.7 nursing visits per episode. The Medicare 
      FFS model without home health care had the lowest reimbursement potential 
      ($964-$1604) per episode. The Medicare fee-for-service within ACO models with 
      home health care had the greatest potential for reimbursement $4519-$4718. There 
      was limited variation in costs by diagnosis. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Though 
      existing payment models might be used to pay for many HaH acute services, 
      significant gaps in reimbursement remain. Extending the benefits of HaH to the 
      Medicare beneficiaries that are likely to derive the greatest benefit will 
      require new payment models for FFS Medicare.

TI  - Differences in Outpatient Dermatology Encounter Work Relative Value Units and Net 
      Payments by Patient Race, Sex, and Age.
PG  - 406-412
LID - 10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.5823 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Clinical productivity measures may be factors in financial incentives 
      for providing care to specific patient populations and thus may perpetuate 
      inequitable health care. OBJECTIVE: To identify the association of patient race, 
      age, and sex with work relative value units (wRVUs) generated by outpatient 
      dermatology encounters. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional 
      study obtained demographic and billing data for outpatient dermatology encounters 
      (ie, an encounter performed within a department of dermatology) from September 1, 
      2016, to March 31, 2020, at the Emory Clinic, an academic dermatologic practice 
      in Atlanta, Georgia. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older with 
      available age, race, and sex data in the electronic health record system. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was wRVUs generated per encounter. 
      RESULTS: A total of 66 463 encounters among 30 036 unique patients were included. 
      Patients had a mean (SD) age of 55.9 (18.5) years and were predominantly White 
      (46 575 [70.1%]) and female (39 598 [59.6%]) individuals. In the general 
      dermatologic practice, the mean (SD) wRVUs per encounter was 1.40 (0.71). In 
      adjusted analysis, Black, Asian, and other races (eg, American Indian or Native 
      American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and multiple races); female 
      sex; and younger age were associated with fewer wRVUs per outpatient dermatology 
      encounter. Compared with general dermatologic visits with White patients, visits 
      with Black patients generated 0.27 (95% CI, 0.25-0.28) fewer wRVUs per encounter, 
      visits with Asian patients generated 0.22 (95% CI, 0.20-0.25) fewer wRVUs per 
      encounter, and visits with patients of other race generated 0.19 (95% CI, 
      0.14-0.24) fewer wRVUs per encounter. Female sex was also associated with 0.11 
      (95% CI, 0.10-0.12) fewer wRVUs per encounter, and wRVUs per encounter increased 
      by 0.006 (95% CI, 0.006-0.006) with each 1-year increase in age. In the general 
      dermatologic practice excluding Mohs surgeons, destruction of premalignant 
      lesions and biopsies were mediators for the observed differences in race (56.2% 
      [95% CI, 53.1%-59.3%] for Black race, 53.2% [95% CI, 45.6%-63.8%] for Asian race, 
      and 53.6% [95% CI, 40.4%-77.4%] for other races), age (65.6%; 95% CI, 
      60.5%-71.4%), and sex (82.3%; 95% CI, 72.7%-93.1%). In a data set including 
      encounters with Mohs surgeons, the race, age, and sex differences in wRVUs per 
      encounter were greater than in the general dermatologic data set. Mohs surgery 
      for basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas was a mediator for the observed 
      differences in race (46.0% [95% CI, 42.6%-49.4%] for Black race, 41.9% [95% CI, 
      35.5%-49.2%] for Asian race, and 34.6% [95% CI, 13.8%-51.5%] for other races), 
      age (49.2%; 95% CI, 44.9%-53.7%), and sex (47.9%; 95% CI, 42.0%-54.6%). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that dermatology 
      encounters with racial minority groups, women, and younger patients generated 
      fewer wRVUs than encounters with older White male patients. This finding suggests 
      that physician compensation based on wRVUs may encourage the provision of 
      services that exacerbate disparities in access to dermatologic care.

PG  - 899-906
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa332 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The electronic health record (EHR) data deluge makes data retrieval 
      more difficult, escalating cognitive load and exacerbating clinician burnout. New 
      auto-summarization techniques are needed. The study goal was to determine if 
      problem-oriented view (POV) auto-summaries improve data retrieval workflows. We 
      hypothesized that POV users would perform tasks faster, make fewer errors, be 
      more satisfied with EHR use, and experience less cognitive load as compared with 
      users of the standard view (SV). METHODS: Simple data retrieval tasks were 
      performed in an EHR simulation environment. A randomized block design was used. 
      In the control group (SV), subjects retrieved lab results and medications by 
      navigating to corresponding sections of the electronic record. In the 
      intervention group (POV), subjects clicked on the name of the problem and 
      immediately saw lab results and medications relevant to that problem. RESULTS: 
      With POV, mean completion time was faster (173 seconds for POV vs 205 seconds for 
      SV; P < .0001), the error rate was lower (3.4% for POV vs 7.7% for SV; 
      P = .0010), user satisfaction was greater (System Usability Scale score 58.5 for 
      POV vs 41.3 for SV; P < .0001), and cognitive task load was less (NASA Task Load 
      Index score 0.72 for POV vs 0.99 for SV; P < .0001). DISCUSSION: The study 
      demonstrates that using a problem-based auto-summary has a positive impact on 4 
      aspects of EHR data retrieval, including cognitive load. CONCLUSION: EHRs have 
      brought on a data deluge, with increased cognitive load and physician burnout. To 
      mitigate these increases, further development and implementation of 
      auto-summarization functionality and the requisite knowledge base are needed.

TI  - Variation of the Inpatient Cost of Care in the Treatment of Isolated Geriatric 
      Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures.
PG  - 2151459320976533

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Geriatric hip fractures are a major, costly public health issue, 
      expected to increase in incidence and expense with the aging population. As 
      healthcare transitions towards value-based care, understanding cost drivers of 
      hip fracture treatment will be necessary to perform adequate risk adjustment. 
      Historically, cost has been variable and difficult to determine. This study was 
      purposed to identify variables that can predict the overall cost of care for 
      geriatric intertrochanteric (IT) hip fractures and provide a better cost 
      prediction to ensure the success of future bundled payment models. METHODS: A 
      retrospective review of operatively-managed geriatric hip fractures was performed 
      at single urban level I academic trauma center between 2013 and 2017. Patient 
      variables were collected via the electronic medical record (EMR) including CCI, 
      ACCI, ASA, overall length of stay (LOS), AO/OTA fracture classification and 
      demographics. Direct and indirect costs were calculated by activity-based costing 
      by the hospital's accounting software. Multivariable linear regression models 
      evaluated which parameters predicted total inpatient cost of care. RESULTS: The 
      mean cost of care was $19,822, ranging from $9,128 to $64,211. Critical care 
      comprised 16.9% of total costs, followed by implant costs (13.6%), and nursing 
      costs (12.6%). Regression analysis identified both ASA (p < 0.01) and ACCI (p = 
      0.01) as statistically significant associative parameters, but only LOS (r (2) = 
      0.77) as a strong correlative measure for inpatient care cost. CONCLUSION: This 
      study found no correlation between ACCI or ASA and the total inpatient cost of 
      care in isolated intertrochanteric geriatric hip fractures, suggesting that the 
      inpatient episode-of-care costs cannot be accurately predicted by the patient 
      demographics/comorbidities alone. Future bundled care payment models would have 
      to be adjusted to account for variables beyond just patient characteristics.

TI  - Episodes of care in a primary care walk-in clinic at a refugee camp in Germany - 
      a retrospective data analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From 2015 to 2016 Germany faced an influx of 1.16 million asylum 
      seekers. In the state of Hamburg Primary Care walk-in clinics (PCWC) were 
      commissioned at refugee camps because the high number of residents (57,000 
      individuals) could not be provided with access to regular healthcare services. 
      Our study aims were (1) to describe the utilization of a PCWC by camp residents, 
      (2) to compare episodes of continuous care with shorter care episodes and (3) to 
      analyse which diagnoses predict episodes of continuous care in this setting. 
      METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal observational study was conducted by 
      reviewing all anonymized electronic medical records of a PCWC that operated from 
      4th November 2015 to 22nd July 2016 at a refugee camp in Hamburg. Episodes of 
      care (EOC) were extracted based on the international classification of primary 
      care-2nd edition (ICPC-2). Outcome parameters were episode duration, principal 
      diagnoses, and medical procedures. RESULTS: We analysed 5547 consultations of 
      1467 patients and extracted 4006 EOC. Mean patient age was 22.7 ± 14.8 years, 
      37.3% were female. Most common diagnoses were infections (44.7%), 
      non-communicable diseases (22.2%), non-definitive diagnoses describing symptoms 
      (22.0%), and injuries (5.7%). Most patients (52.4%) had only single encounters, 
      whereas 19.8% had at least one EOC with a duration of ≥ 28 days (defined as 
      continuous care). Several procedures were more prevalent in EOC with continuous 
      care: Blood tests (5.2 times higher), administrative procedures (4.3), imaging 
      (3.1) and referrals to secondary care providers (3.0). Twenty prevalent 
      ICPC-2-diagnosis groups were associated with continuous care. The strongest 
      associations were endocrine/metabolic system and nutritional disorders (hazard 
      ratio 5.538, p < 0.001), dermatitis/atopic eczema (4.279, p < 0.001) and 
      psychological disorders (4.056, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A wide spectrum of acute 
      and chronic health conditions could be treated at a GP-led PCWC with few 
      referrals or use of medical resources. But we also observed episodes of 
      continuous care with more use of medical resources and referrals. Therefore, we 
      conclude that principles of primary care like continuity of care, coordination of 
      care and management of symptomatic complaints could complement future healthcare 
      concepts for refugee camps.

TI  - Man vs. machine: Predicting hospital bed demand from an emergency department.
PG  - e0237937

LID - e0237937
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent literature reports promising results from using 
      intelligent systems to support decision making in healthcare operations. Using 
      these systems may lead to improved diagnostic and treatment protocols and to 
      predict hospital bed demand. Predicting hospital bed demand in emergency 
      department (ED) attendances could help resource allocation and reduce pressure on 
      busy hospitals. However, there is still limited knowledge on whether intelligent 
      systems can operate as fully autonomous, user-independent systems. OBJECTIVE: 
      Compare the performance of a computer-based algorithm and humans in predicting 
      hospital bed demand (admissions and discharges) based on the initial SOAP 
      (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) records of the ED. METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective cohort study that compared the performance of humans and machines 
      in predicting hospital bed demand from an ED. It considered electronic medical 
      records (EMR) of 9030 patients (230 used as a testing set, and hence evaluated 
      both by humans and by an algorithm, and 8800 used as a training set exclusively 
      by the algorithm) who visited the ED of a tertiary care and teaching public 
      hospital located in Porto Alegre, Brazil between January and December 2014. The 
      machine role was played by Support Vector Machine Classifier and the human 
      prediction was performed by four ED physicians. Predictions were compared in 
      terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC). RESULTS: All graders achieved similar 
      accuracies. The accuracy by AUROC for the testing set was 0.82 [95% confidence 
      interval (CI) of 0.77-0.87], 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75-0.85), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.71-0.81) 
      for novice physicians, machine, experienced physicians, respectively. Processing 
      time per test EMR was 0.00812±0.0009 seconds. In contrast, novice physicians took 
      on average 156.80 seconds per test EMR, while experienced physicians took on 
      average 56.40 seconds per test EMR. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that the 
      system could predict patient admission or discharge states with 80% accuracy, 
      which was similar the performance of novice and experienced physicians. These 
      results suggested that the algorithm could operate as an autonomous and 
      independent system to complete this task.

TI  - Drivers for nonhome discharge in a consecutive series of 1502 patients undergoing 
      1- or 2-level lumbar fusion.
PG  - 1-6

LID - 10.3171/2020.5.SPINE20410 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Unexpected nonhome discharge causes additional costs in the current 
      reimbursement models, especially to the payor. Nonhome discharge is also related 
      to longer length of hospital stay and therefore higher healthcare costs to 
      society. With increasing demand for spine surgery, it is important to minimize 
      costs by streamlining discharges and reducing length of hospital stay. 
      Identifying factors associated with nonhome discharge can be useful for early 
      intervention for discharge planning. The authors aimed to identify the drivers of 
      nonhome discharge in patients undergoing 1- or 2-level instrumented lumbar 
      fusion. METHODS: The electronic medical records from a single-center hospital 
      administrative database were analyzed for consecutive patients who underwent 1- 
      to 2-level instrumented lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar conditions during 
      the period from 2016 to 2018. Discharge disposition was determined as home or 
      nonhome. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations 
      between nonhome discharge and age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, American 
      Society of Anesthesiologists grade, smoking status, marital status, insurance 
      type, residence in an underserved zip code, and operative factors. RESULTS: A 
      total of 1502 patients were included. The majority (81%) were discharged home. 
      Factors associated with a nonhome discharge were older age, higher BMI, living in 
      an underserved zip code, not being married, being on government insurance, and 
      having more levels fused. Patients discharged to a nonhome facility had longer 
      lengths of hospital stay (5.6 vs 3.0 days, p < 0.001) and significantly increased 
      hospital costs ($21,204 vs $17,518, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increased age, 
      greater BMI, residence in an underserved zip code, not being married, and 
      government insurance are drivers for discharge to a nonhome facility after a 1- 
      to 2-level instrumented lumbar fusion. Early identification and intervention for 
      these patients, even before admission, may decrease the length of hospital stay 
      and medical costs.

TI  - Characterizing outpatient problem list completeness and duplications in the 
      electronic health record.
PG  - 1190-1197
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa125 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study sought to characterize rates of problem list completeness 
      and duplications in common chronic diseases and to identify any relationships 
      that they may have with respect to disease type, demographics, and disease 
      severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 
      electronic health record data from Partners HealthCare. We selected 8 common 
      chronic diseases and identified patients with each of those diseases. We then 
      analyzed each patient's problem list for completeness and duplications and also 
      collected information regarding demographics and disease severity. Rates of 
      completeness and duplications were calculated for each disease and compared 
      according to disease type, demographics, and disease severity. RESULTS: A total 
      of 327 695 unique patients and 383 404 problem list entries were identified. 
      Problem list completeness varied from 72.9% in hypertension to 93.5% in asthma, 
      whereas problem list duplications varied from 4.8% in hypertension to 28.2% in 
      diabetes. There was a variable relationship between demographic factors and rates 
      of completeness and duplication. Rates of completeness were positively correlated 
      with disease severity for most diseases. Rates of duplication were consistently 
      positively correlated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: Incompleteness and 
      duplications are both important issues in problem lists. These issues vary widely 
      across different diseases and can also be impacted by patient demographics and 
      disease severity. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of 
      individual user behaviors and organizational policies on problem list 
      utilization, which will aid the development of interventions that improve the 
      utility of problem lists.

AB  - To keep healthcare effective, accessible and affordable to all we need a 
      fundamental paradigm shift. Self-management for prevention and care with the help 
      of healthcare professionals, having a shared view of the state of well-being, 
      will play a significant role in this transition. The problem list is widely 
      adopted as centerpiece of electronic health records and is although often patient 
      oriented, but mostly limited to the institutional level. The requirements for 
      this paradigm shift has been discussed in a series of workshops. Truly 
      person-centered care requires to move towards a holistic problem list with an 
      assessment and planning process resulting in an overarching care plan. The change 
      process towards a real person-centered problem list, integrated in an overarching 
      care plan, should be focused on the transition of health services delivery and 
      requires a transition based on the "Quadruple Aim" principles.

AB  - The Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) is considered a key charting method to 
      support clinical care. Although not uniformly represented amongst digital health 
      systems, this paper presents a clinical model to represent multiple clinical 
      perspectives from a single problem list. The contextual problem list model is 
      defined according to primary diagnosis, comorbidities and problems arising from 
      the primary condition. It is represented within the patient record as a single 
      composition according to the prescribed context. The model pattern could help 
      alleviate the traditional criticisms of paper and digitally based problem 
      records.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Electronic health records (EHR) comprehend structured and 
      unstructured data, that are usually time dependent, enabling the use of 
      timelines. However, it is often difficult to display all data without inducing 
      information overload. In both clinical usual care and medical research, users 
      should be able to quickly find relevant information, with minimal cognitive 
      overhead. Our goal was to devise simple visualization techniques for handling 
      medical data in both contexts. METHODS: An abstraction layer for structured EHR 
      data was devised after an informal literature review and discussions between 
      authors. The "Heimdall" prototype was developed. Two experts evaluated the tool 
      by answering 5 questions on 24 clinical cases. RESULTS: Temporal data was 
      abstracted in three simple types: events, states and measures, with appropriate 
      visual representations for each type. Heimdall can load and display complex 
      heterogeneous structured temporal data in a straightforward way. The main view 
      can display events, states and measures along a shared timeline. Users can 
      summarize data using temporal, hierarchical compression and filters. Default and 
      custom views can be used to work in problem- oriented ways. The evaluation found 
      conclusive results. CONCLUSION: The "Heimdall" prototype provides a comprehensive 
      and efficient graphical interface for EHR data visualization. It is open source, 
      can be used with an R package, and is available at https://koromix.dev/files/R.

TI  - Factors Influencing Problem List Use in Electronic Health Records-Application of 
      the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology.
PG  - 415-426

AB  - BACKGROUND: Problem-oriented electronic health record (EHR) systems can help 
      physicians to track a patient's status and progress, and organize clinical 
      documentation, which could help improving quality of clinical data and enable 
      data reuse. The problem list is central in a problem-oriented medical record. 
      However, current problem lists remain incomplete because of the lack of end-user 
      training and inaccurate content of underlying terminologies. This leads to 
      modifications of diagnosis code descriptions and use of free-text notes, limiting 
      reuse of data. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate factors that influence 
      acceptance and actual use of the problem list, and used these to propose 
      recommendations, to increase the value of problem lists for (re)use. METHODS: 
      Semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians, heads of medical 
      departments, and data quality experts, who were invited through snowball 
      sampling. The interviews were transcribed and coded. Comments were fitted in 
      constructs of the validated framework unified theory of acceptance user 
      technology (UTAUT), and were discussed in terms of facilitators and barriers. 
      RESULTS: In total, 24 interviews were conducted. We found large variability in 
      attitudes toward problem list use. Barriers included uncertainty about the 
      responsibility for maintaining the problem list and little perceived benefits. 
      Facilitators included the (re)design of policies, improved (peer-to-peer) 
      training to increase motivation, and positive peer feedback and monitoring. 
      Motivation is best increased through sharing benefits relevant in the care 
      process, such as providing overview, timely generation of discharge or referral 
      letters, and reuse of data. Furthermore, content of the underlying terminology 
      should be improved and the problem list should be better presented in the EHR 
      system. CONCLUSION: To let physicians accept and use the problem list, policies 
      and guidelines should be redesigned, and prioritized by supervising staff. 
      Additionally, peer-to-peer training on the benefits of using the problem list is 
      needed.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the patterns of discharge and 
      re-enrollment to a community palliative care service, and to identify factors 
      associated with re-enrollment. Background: Community-based palliative care is a 
      limited resource. The evidence base to guide discharge practices from community 
      palliative care services is limited. Methods: A retrospective audit of the 
      electronic medical records for all patients discharged from the Sacred Heart 
      Community Palliative Care Service (SHCPCS), Sydney, from July 2010 to July 2016 
      was conducted. Patients were excluded if they were discharged due to death, 
      transferred out of catchment area, declined the service, transferred to another 
      hospital, or were referred inappropriately. Data extracted included 
      sociodemographic variables, living situation, diagnoses, and discharge and 
      re-enrollment details. Using binary logistic regression analysis, predictive 
      factors, including socio-demographic characteristics, diagnosis and length of 
      episode of care, were evaluated. Results: Of the 739 patients who met the 
      inclusion criteria, 42 (5.7%) were re-enrolled to the service. The median length 
      of the initial episode of care was 65 days and the median timeframe between 
      discharge and re-enrollment was 216 days. Patients living in residential care 
      facilities (odds ratio [OR] 3.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28-9.28; 
      p = 0.01) and those with malignant diagnoses (OR 2.22; 95% CI 1.00-4.93; 
      p = 0.04) had higher rates of re-enrollment. Discussion: The proportion of 
      patients re-enrolled to the service was low. Both patient factors and disease 
      factors were associated with re-enrollment. Future prospective studies evaluating 
      prognostic factors to assist with effective discharge processes and guidelines 
      are warranted.

TI  - Problems with the problem list: challenges of transparency in an era of patient 
      curation.
PG  - 981-984
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocaa040 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, the OpenNotes movement and other changes in healthcare have 
      driven institutions to make medical records increasingly transparent. As patients 
      have begun to question and request changes to their Problem Lists, clinicians 
      have come to face the ever more frequent challenge of discerning which changes to 
      make and which to refuse. Now clinicians and patients together choose the list of 
      problems that represent the patient's current state of health and illness. As the 
      physician's role slides closer to consultant and the medical paternalism of the 
      twentieth century falls further into the background of our technology-infused 
      present, who holds the power of delineating a patient's clinical identity? This 
      paper examines the ethical and practical dimensions of this question and proposes 
      a research agenda that aims to answer it. Such explorations are essential to

TI  - Towards augmenting structured EHR data: a comparison of manual chart review and 
      patient self-report.
PG  - 903-912
AB  - Structured electronic health record (EHR) data are often used for quality 
      measurement and improvement, clinical research, and other secondary uses. These 
      data, however, are known to suffer from quality problems. There may be value in 
      augmenting structured EHR data to improve data quality, thereby improving the 
      reliability and validity of the conclusions drawn from those data. Focusing on 
      five diagnoses related to cardiovascular care, this paper considers the added 
      value of two alternative data sources: manual chart abstraction and patient 
      self-report. We assess the overall agreement between structured EHR problem list 
      data, abstracted EHR data, and patient self- report; and explore possible causes 
      of disagreement between those sources. Our findings suggest that both chart 
      abstraction and patient self-report contain significantly more diagnoses than the 
      problem list, but that the information they capture is different. Methods for 
      collecting and validating self-reported medical data require further 
      consideration and exploration.

TI  - The Association of Loneliness and Non-prescribed Opioid Use in Patients With 
      Opioid Use Disorder.
PG  - 489-493
LID - 10.1097/ADM.0000000000000629 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between loneliness and non-prescribed 
      opioid use in patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder (OUD). METHODS: This 
      was a cohort study conducted at a federally qualified health center (FQHC) in New 
      Haven, CT. Patients who were treated for OUD by health center providers and 
      prescribed buprenorphine were eligible. Participants were asked to complete the 
      UCLA-Loneliness Scale Version 3. From the electronic medical record, we collected 
      patient demographic and clinical characteristics as well as the results of 
      biological fluid testing obtained throughout their treatment course since entry 
      into care. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify 
      independent predictors of the detection of non-prescribed opioids within 
      biological fluid. RESULTS: Of the 82 patients enrolled in the study, 33 (40.3%) 
      of the participants had at least 1 biological fluid test positive for 
      non-prescribed opioids after maintenance onto buprenorphine treatment. A higher 
      loneliness score was associated with increased odds of non-prescribed opioids 
      (adjusted odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.27). Patient age, the 
      number of problems on the problems list, and cocaine use were also positively 
      associated with the presence of non-prescribed opioids whereas having diabetes 
      was negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS: Among the individuals being treated with 
      buprenorphine for OUD, loneliness may be a risk factor for the use of 
      non-prescribed opioids or treatment failure.

TI  - Electronic Health Record and Problem Lists in Leeds, United Kingdom: Variability 
      of general practitioners' views.
PG  - 1898-1911
LID - 10.1177/1460458219895184 [doi]
AB  - Data sharing of Electronic Health Records from general practices to secondary 
      care in Leeds occurs through the so-called Leeds Care Records, which collects a 
      specific set of codes from primary care, known as 'Active Problems', and presents 
      it to the user. Variability on its content is a known issue. To explore general 
      practitioners' views on their use of 'Active Problems' and on sharing data, so 
      lessons could be learnt on how to homogenise and improve shared data. Assessing 
      Leeds general practitioners' views through two parallel processes (60 online 
      surveys and 17 interviews). General practitioners feel they do not have the time 
      nor the training required for keeping a shared approach to concise and current 
      Problem Lists in electronic patient records. Action is needed to reduce current 
      variability, and to improve the quality of shared information. Some types of 
      codes currently present in Problem Lists have very little support among general 
      practitioners who consider the focus should be on long-term conditions and 
      probably adding current acute diagnoses and life expectancy items and not 
      omitting sensitive information. There is a perceived need of training and time to 
      update Problem Lists if their quality is to improve.

TI  - Two algorithms for the reorganisation of the problem list by organ system.
LID - 10.1136/bmjhci-2019-100024 [doi]
LID - e100024
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Long problem lists can be challenging to use. Reorganisation of the 
      problem list by organ system is a strategy for making long problem lists more 
      manageable. METHODS: In a small-town primary care setting, we examined 4950 
      unique problem lists over 5 years (24 033 total problems and 2170 unique 
      problems) from our electronic health record. All problems were mapped to the 
      International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification 
      (ICD-10-CM) and SNOMED CT codes. We developed two different algorithms for 
      reorganising the problem list by organ system based on either the ICD-10-CM or 
      the SNOMED CT code. RESULTS: The mean problem list length was 4.9±4.6 problems. 
      The two reorganisation algorithms allocated problems to one of 15 different 
      categories (12 aligning with organ systems). 26.2% of problems were assigned to a 
      more general category of 'signs and symptoms' that did not correspond to a single 
      organ system. The two algorithms were concordant in allocation by organ system 
      for 90% of the unique problems. Since ICD-10-CM is a monohierarchic 
      classification system, problems coded by ICD-10-CM were assigned to a single 
      category. Since SNOMED CT is a polyhierarchical ontology, 19.4% of problems coded 
      by SNOMED CT were assigned to multiple categories. CONCLUSION: Reorganisation of 
      the problem list by organ system is feasible using algorithms based on either 
      ICD-10-CM or SNOMED CT codes, and the two algorithms are highly concordant.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe elements of an interprofessional second year capstone 
      experience designed to incorporate each step of the Pharmacists' Patient Care 
      Process (PPCP) and to evaluate changes in attitudes towards interprofessional 
      collaboration. METHODS: Second year pharmacy students collaborated with dental 
      students to collect information from a standardized patient (SP), assess dental 
      and pharmacy-related problems, and develop a plan resolving the problems 
      identified. Students documented via a SOAP note (subjective, objective, 
      assessment, and plan) and followed up with the SP after an emergency room visit, 
      developing a new plan for implementation. Pharmacy students followed up in the 
      inpatient setting when the SP was preparing for discharge, collecting information 
      from the electronic health record (EHR), assessing the patient's medical 
      conditions, and planning for treatment. Multiple assessment methods were used 
      including extended multiple-choice questions (eMCQs) to assess clinical reasoning 
      skills and a rubric for SOAP note grading. RESULTS: Students performed well on 
      the assessments especially communicating with the SP during medication history 
      and discharge counseling and documenting their care in a SOAP note. Students 
      stated value was added to their education through this experience. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This capstone allowed students the opportunity to practice each step of the PPCP 
      and to collaborate as a member of an interprofessional team As the PPCP is 
      integrated into pharmacy curricula, assessments such as this will be essential 
      for determining practice-readiness and team-readiness of graduates.

TI  - Developing a standardised approach to the aggregation of inpatient episodes into 
      person-based spells in all specialties and psychiatric specialties.
PG  - 246
LID - 10.1186/s12911-019-0953-2 [doi]
LID - 246
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) data are available for research in all 
      UK nations and cross-nation comparative studies are becoming more common. All UK 
      inpatient EHRs are based around episodes, but episode-based analysis may not 
      sufficiently capture the patient journey. There is no UK-wide method for 
      aggregating episodes into standardised person-based spells. This study identifies 
      two data quality issues affecting the creation of person-based spells, and tests 
      four methods to create these spells, for implementation across all UK nations. 
      METHODS: Welsh inpatient EHRs from 2013 to 2017 were analysed. Phase one 
      described two data quality issues; transfers of care and episode sequencing. 
      Phase two compared four methods for creating person spells. Measures were mean 
      length of stay (LOS, expressed in days) and number of episodes per person spell 
      for each method. RESULTS: 3.5% of total admissions were transfers-in and 3.1% of 
      total discharges were transfers-out. 68.7% of total transfers-in and 48.7% of 
      psychiatric transfers-in had an identifiable preceding transfer-out, and 78.2% of 
      total transfers-out and 59.0% of psychiatric transfers-out had an identifiable 
      subsequent transfer-in. 0.2% of total episodes and 4.0% of psychiatric episodes 
      overlapped with at least one other episode of any specialty. Method one (no 
      evidence of transfer required; overlapping episodes grouped together) resulted in 
      the longest mean LOS (4.0 days for all specialties; 48.5 days for psychiatric 
      specialties) and the fewest single episode person spells (82.4% of all 
      specialties; 69.7% for psychiatric specialties). Method three (evidence of 
      transfer required; overlapping episodes separated) resulted in the shortest mean 
      LOS (3.7 days for all specialties; 45.8 days for psychiatric specialties) and the 
      most single episode person spells; (86.9% for all specialties; 86.3% for 
      psychiatric specialties). CONCLUSIONS: Transfers-in appear better recorded than 
      transfers-out. Transfer coding is incomplete, particularly for psychiatric 
      specialties. The proportion of episodes that overlap is small but psychiatric 
      episodes are disproportionately affected. The most successful method for grouping 
      episodes into person spells aggregated overlapping episodes and required no 
      evidence of transfer from admission source/method or discharge destination codes. 
      The least successful method treated overlapping episodes as distinct and required 
      transfer coding. The impact of all four methods was greater for psychiatric 
      specialties.

TI  - Trajectory analysis for postoperative pain using electronic health records: A 
      nonparametric method with robust linear regression and K-medians cluster 
      analysis.
PG  - 1404-1418
LID - 10.1177/1460458219881339 [doi]
AB  - Postoperative pain scores are widely monitored and collected in the electronic 
      health record, yet current methods fail to fully leverage the data with fast 
      implementation. A robust linear regression was fitted to describe the association 
      between the log-scaled pain score and time from discharge after total knee 
      replacement. The estimated trajectories were used for a subsequent K-medians 
      cluster analysis to categorize the longitudinal pain score patterns into distinct 
      clusters. For each cluster, a mixture regression model estimated the association 
      between pain score and time to discharge adjusting for confounding. The fitted 
      regression model generated the pain trajectory pattern for given cluster. 
      Finally, regression analyses examined the association between pain trajectories 
      and patient outcomes. A total of 3442 surgeries were identified with a median of 
      22 pain scores at an academic hospital during 2009-2016. Four pain trajectory 
      patterns were identified and one was associated with higher rates of outcomes. In 
      conclusion, we described a novel approach with fast implementation to model 
      patients' pain experience using electronic health records. In the era of big data 
      science, clinical research should be learning from all available data regarding a 
      patient's episode of care instead of focusing on the "average" patient outcomes.

TI  - A Daily Hospital Progress Note that Increases Physician Usability of the 
      Electronic Health Record by Facilitating a Problem-Oriented Approach to the 
      Patient and Reducing Physician Clerical Burden.
LID - 10.7812/TPP/18-221 [doi]
LID - 18-221
AB  - We suggest changes in the electronic health record (EHR) in hospitalized patients 
      to increase EHR usability by optimizing the physician's ability to approach the 
      patient in a problem-oriented fashion and by reducing physician data entry and 
      chart navigation. The framework for these changes is a Physician's Daily Hospital 
      Progress Note organized into 3 sections: Subjective, Objective, and a combined 
      Assessment and Plan section, subdivided by problem titles. The EHR would 
      consolidate information for each problem by: 1) juxtaposing to each problem title 
      relevant medications, key durable results, and limitations; 2) entering in the 
      running lists under Assessment and Plan the most relevant information for that 
      day, including abbreviated versions of relevant reports; and 3) generating a flow 
      sheet in a problem's progress note for any key results tracked daily. To reduce 
      physician EHR navigation, the EHR would place in the Objective section 
      abbreviated versions of notes of other physicians, nurses, and allied health 
      professionals as well as recent orders. The physician would enter only the 
      analysis and plan and new information not included in the EHR. The consolidation 
      of information for each problem would facilitate physician communication at 
      points of transition of care including generation of a problem-oriented discharge 
      summary.

TI  - A smart decision: smartphone use for operative data collection in arthroscopic 
      shoulder instability surgery.
PG  - 1030-1036
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz074 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study tested validity, accuracy, and efficiency of the 
      Orthopaedic Minimal Data Set Episode of Care (OME) compared with traditional 
      operative report in arthroscopic surgery for shoulder instability. As of November 
      2017, OME had successfully captured baseline data on 97% of 18 700 eligible 
      cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzes 100 cases entered into OME 
      through smartphones by 12 surgeons at an institution from February to October 
      2015. A blinded reviewer extracted the same variables from operative report into 
      a separate database. Completion rates and agreement were compared. They were 
      assessed using raw percentages and McNemar's test (with continuity correction). 
      Agreement between nominal variables was assessed by unweighted Cohen's kappa and 
      a concordance correlation coefficient measured agreement between continuous 
      variables. Efficiency was assessed by median time to complete. RESULTS: Of 37 
      variables, OME demonstrated equal or higher completion rates for all but 1 and 
      had significantly higher capture rates for 49% (n = 18; P < .05). Of 33 nominal 
      variables, raw proportional agreement was ≥0.90 for 76% (n = 25). Raw 
      proportional agreement was perfect for 15% (n = 5); no agreement statistic could 
      be calculated due to a single variable in operative note and OME. Calculated 
      agreement statistic was substantial or better (κ > 0.61) for 51% (n = 17) for the 
      33 nominal variables. All continuous variables assessed (n = 4) demonstrated poor 
      agreement (concordance correlation coefficient <0.90). Median time for completing 
      OME was 103.5 (interquartile range, 80.5-151) seconds. CONCLUSIONS: The OME 
      smartphone data capture system routinely captured more data than operative report 
      and demonstrated acceptable agreement for nearly all nominal variables, yet took 
      <2 minutes to complete on average.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study tested validity and efficiency of Orthopaedic Minimal Data 
      Set (OrthoMiDaS) Episode of Care (OME). METHODS: We analyzed 100 isolated rotator 
      cuff repair cases in the OME database. Surgeons completed a traditional operative 
      note and OME report. A blinded reviewer extracted data from operative notes and 
      implant logs in electronic medical records by manual chart review. OME and 
      electronic medical record data were compared with data counts and agreement 
      between 40 variables of rotator cuff disease and repair procedures. Data counts 
      were assessed using raw percentages and McNemar test (with continuity 
      correction). Agreement of categorical variables was analyzed using Cohen κ 
      (unweighted) and of numerical variables using the concordance correlation 
      coefficient (CCC). Efficiency was assessed by median time to complete. RESULTS: 
      OME database had significantly higher data counts for 25% (10/40) of variables. A 
      high level of proportional and statistical agreement was demonstrated between the 
      data. Among 35 categorical variables, proportional agreement was perfect for 17%, 
      almost perfect (0.81 ≤ κ ≤ 1.00) for 37%, substantial (0.61 ≤ κ ≤ 0.80) for 20%, 
      moderate (0.41 ≤ κ ≤ 0.60) for 14%, fair (0.21 ≤ κ ≤ 0.40) for 6%, and slight 
      (0.0 ≤ κ ≤ 0.20) for 6%. Of 5 numerical variables, agreement was almost perfect 
      (CCC > 0.99) for 20% and poor (CCC < 0.90) for 80%. Median OME completion time 
      was 161.5 seconds (interquartile range, 116-224.5). CONCLUSION: OME is an 
      efficient, valid tool for collecting comprehensive, standardized data on rotator 
      cuff repair.

TI  - The rates and determinants of disengagement and subsequent re-engagement in young 
      people with first-episode psychosis.
PG  - 945-953
LID - 10.1007/s00127-019-01698-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A core component of treatment provided by early intervention for 
      psychosis (EI) services is ensuring individuals remain successfully engaged with 
      the service. This ensures they can receive the care they may need at this 
      critical early stage of illness. Unfortunately, rates of disengagement are high 
      in individuals with a first episode of psychosis (FEP), representing a major 
      barrier to effective treatment. This study aimed to ascertain the rates and 
      determinants of disengagement and subsequent re-engagement of young people with 
      FEP in a well-established EI service in Melbourne, Australia. METHOD: This cohort 
      study involved all young people, aged 15-24, who presented to the Early Psychosis 
      Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) service with FEP between 1st January 
      2011 and 1st September 2014. Data were collected retrospectively from clinical 
      files and electronic records. Cox regression analysis was used to identify 
      determinants of disengagement and re-engagement. RESULTS: A total of 707 young 
      people presented with FEP during the study period, of which complete data were 
      available for 700. Over half of the cohort (56.3%, N = 394) disengaged at least 
      once during their treatment period, however, the majority of these individuals 
      (85.5%, N = 337) subsequently re-engaged following the initial episode of 
      disengagement. Of those who disengaged from the service, 54 never re-engaged, 
      representing 7.6% of the total cohort. Not being in employment, education or 
      training, not having a family history of psychosis in second degree relatives and 
      using cannabis were found to be significant predictors of disengagement. No 
      significant predictors of re-engagement were identified. CONCLUSION: In this 
      study, the rate of disengagement in young people with first-episode psychosis was 
      higher than found previously. Encouragingly, rates of re-engagement were also 
      high. The concept of disengagement from services might be more complex than 
      previously thought with individuals disengaging and re-engaging a number of times 
      during their episode of care. What prompts individuals to re-engage with services 
      needs to be better understood.

TI  - Characterizing the Utilization of the Problem List for Pediatric Trauma Care.
PG  - 404-412
AB  - The EHR problem list has the potential to support care coordination among the 
      multidisciplinary care team that cares for pediatric trauma patients. To realize 
      this potential, the need exists to ensure appropriate utilization by formulating 
      acceptable usage and management policy. In this regard, understanding the 
      prevailing utilization pattern is pivotal. To this end, we analyzed EHR in tandem 
      with trauma registry data at a Level I pediatric trauma center. Almost all 
      (97.8%) of the actions executed on the problem list were addition of items. Among 
      the 517 patient encounters in the cohort, 263 (48.9%) encounters involving sicker 
      patients had at least one problem list item added, mostly within the first 4 
      hours of arrival, while in the emergency department, and by providers in the 
      service of record. This represents a foundation to build upon. Subsequent 
      research will explore completeness, accuracy, and the impact of the utilization 
      on patient outcomes.

TI  - It's Time to Wikify Clinical Documentation: How Collaborative Authorship Can 
      Reduce the Burden and Improve the Quality of the Electronic Health Record.
PG  - 645-650
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0000000000002613 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) have become ubiquitous tools and represent the 
      standard of care for 96% of hospitals and 86% of ambulatory physicians in the 
      United States. With adoption of EHRs came the promise of improved efficiency, 
      higher-quality care, and lower costs. Unfortunately, some clinicians are now 
      spending twice as much time on documentation as they spend seeing patients, and 
      the documentation paradigm of problem-oriented medical records is contributing to 
      this imbalance. It is time to consider new innovations. The collaborative wiki 
      format offers many opportunities to ease the burden of documentation as well as 
      to increase the usefulness of the recorded clinical data. Wikis support multiple 
      authorship, have built-in features to track edits and changes, allow for 
      contextual linkages (e.g., linking medical problems to their treatment), and 
      support new technologies such as application programming interfaces, which allow 
      for safe and secure exchange of information. In this Perspective, the authors 
      describe the rationale for considering this approach to clinical documentation 
      and propose a pilot to learn about its effectiveness. They believe wiki-based 
      documentation will become increasingly attractive, especially as new legislation 
      and directives from policymakers seek to reduce the crushing documentation burden 
      and as the U.S. health care system transitions from an episode-based payment 
      structure to a value-based, outcomes-focused system.

TI  - Pentafluorosulfanyl-containing Triclocarban Analogs with Potent Antimicrobial 
      Activity.
LID - 10.3390/molecules23112853 [doi]
LID - 2853
AB  - Concerns have been raised about the long-term accumulating effects of 
      triclocarban, a polychlorinated diarylurea widely used as an antibacterial soap 
      additive, in the environment and in human beings. Indeed, the Food and Drug 
      Administration has recently banned it from personal care products. Herein, we 
      report the synthesis, antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of novel 
      N,N'-diarylureas as triclocarban analogs, designed by reducing one or more 
      chlorine atoms of the former and/or replacing them by the novel 
      pentafluorosulfanyl group, a new bioisostere of the trifluoromethyl group, with 
      growing importance in drug discovery. Interestingly, some of these 
      pentafluorosulfanyl-bearing ureas exhibited high potency, broad spectrum of 
      antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, and high 
      selectivity index, while displaying a lower spontaneous mutation frequency than 
      triclocarban. Some lines of evidence suggest a bactericidal mode of action for 
      this family of compounds.

TI  - Caveats for the Use of the Active Problem List as Ground Truth for Decision 
      Support.
PG  - 10-14
AB  - Diagnoses recorded on the problem list are increasingly being used for decision 
      support applications. To obtain insight in the adequacy of the clinical user 
      interface to capture what the clinician has in mind, and to reconstruct the 
      clinical reality of the patient, we analyzed in the database of an EHR system the 
      transactions that resulted from managing the problem list. Our findings indicate 
      (1) that caution is required when using the evolution of the problem list for 
      determining comorbidity or ongoing disease, and (2) that similarities or 
      differences in problem list annotation sequences do not always correspond with 
      similarities resp. differences in disease courses. It is to be investigated 
      whether automatically identifiable subsets of problem list evolution patterns 
      exist from which ground truth reliably can be inferred or whether clinicians need 
      more education in how problem list user interfaces should be used to avoid 
      erroneous interpretations by clinical decision support applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies investigating daily chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) 
      bathing as an infection control intervention to decrease health care-associated 
      infections have focused on reduction of infection and colonization; few studies 
      have assessed CHG bathing compliance, work system factors, facilitators, and 
      barriers to implementation. METHODS: This is a combination 
      retrospective/prospective pilot study conducted at a large academic teaching 
      hospital that implemented daily CHG bathing across all inpatient units. CHG 
      compliance and patient refusal were calculated on the basis of documentation in 
      the electronic medical record. We used the health belief model to guide 
      semistructured interviews with patients about knowledge and barriers related to 
      CHG bathing. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients interviewed, 74% reported using CHG soap 
      during their stay. Average compliance documented in the electronic medical record 
      was 78% with a range of 57%-91% among all hospital units. Sixteen percent of 
      patients declined CHG bathing, and refusal ranged from 3%-29% among all units. 
      Major themes about CHG bathing from patient interviews include low perceived 
      susceptibility to infection, high degree of trust in medical professionals, low 
      knowledge of benefits of CHG, and low perceived self-efficacy in preventing HAIs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Educating patients about CHG bathing appears to be a critical factor 
      in decreasing patient refusal of CHG bathing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The OrthoMiDaS (Orthopedic Minimal Data Set) Episode of Care (OME) 
      database was developed in an effort to advance orthopedic outcome measurements on 
      a national scale. This study was designed to evaluate if the OME data capture 
      system would increase the quality of data collected in the context of primary and 
      revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) compared to conventional operative notes. 
      METHODS: This study includes data from the first 100 primary THAs and 100 
      revision THAs performed by 15 surgeons at a single institution from January 
      through April 2016. Surgeons prospectively entered procedural details into OME 
      following surgery. The OME database and operative notes were compared to evaluate 
      completion rates and agreement. Completion rates were compared using McNemar's 
      test (with continuity correction), while agreement was analyzed using Cohen's 
      kappa (κ) and concordance correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The OME database had 
      significantly higher completion rates for 41% (39/96) of the variables. 
      Proportion of data points that matched between the operative notes and OME data 
      revealed that 54% (52/96) had a proportion agreement >0.90, and 79% (76/96) had a 
      proportion agreement >0.80. In regard to measured agreement, 25% (24/96) of 
      variables had almost perfect agreement, 29% (28/96) had substantial agreement, 
      and 14% (13/96) had moderate agreement. Only 4% (4/96) had fair agreement, 8% 
      (8/96) had slight agreement, and 6% (6/96) had poor agreement. CONCLUSION: The 
      OME data capture system is an efficient tool to document procedural details 
      following THA. The system is user-friendly, comprehensive, and accurate. It has 
      the potential to be a valuable tool for future orthopedic research.

AB  - PURPOSE: The extent to which medication prescriptions had a reason for the 
      medication use documented in form of a potential indication within the electronic 
      health record (EHR) problem lists using a MEDication Indication (MEDI) resource 
      was evaluated. METHODS: Prescriptions from January 1 to June 30, 2015, comparing 
      them to patients' problem lists using MEDI and the MEDI High Precision Subset 
      (MEDI-HPS) were analyzed. RxNorm generic ingredient name codes in MEDI were used 
      to map prescriptions to problems using codes from the International 
      Classification of Diseases, 9th edition. A reference standard was established to 
      evaluate the MEDI precision and recall by having 2 pharmacists independently 
      manually review prescriptions and problem lists from 30 randomly selected 
      patients. RESULTS: For 62,191 patients, 61% of prescriptions matched a potential 
      indication on the patient's problem list using MEDI, whereas only 38% had a match 
      using MEDI-HPS. The precision of MEDI compared to the reference standard was 47% 
      with a recall of 57%, whereas MEDI-HPS had a precision of 79% and recall of 96%. 
      Secondary analysis excluding medication prescribed with a supply of ≤14 days gave 
      slightly better, yet not significant, results. CONCLUSION: Analysis of patient 
      records found most patients did not have an indication listed in the EHR problem 
      list that would match a specific medication, suggesting that the problem lists 
      may be incomplete. When using MEDI, 61% of prescriptions matched to the problem 
      list, compared with only 38% using MEDI-HPS. Likewise, 37% of problems matched to 
      prescriptions when using MEDI, compared with only 21% using MEDI-HPS.

TI  - Mapping Drug Overdose Demographic and Socioeconomic Characteristics in the 
      Community.
PG  - 18-23
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Drug use and drug overdose have increased at an alarming rate. 
      OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic and neighborhood social and economic factors 
      associated with higher risk of overdose. These findings can be used to inform 
      development of community programs and appropriately devote resources to prevent 
      and treat drug abuse. METHODS: The electronic health records of all patients seen 
      in the emergency department or admitted to the hospital for a drug overdose in 
      2016 at Gundersen Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin, were reviewed 
      retrospectively. Patient data collected included age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
      insurance type, overdose intention (intentional, unintentional), drug involved, 
      and total charge for the episode of care. Patient residence was geocode mapped to 
      census tract to analyze the relationship of drug overdose to neighborhood 
      characteristics. Overdose rates were calculated by census tract and compared by 
      several sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Four hundred nineteen patients 
      were included in this study. Forty percent of overdoses were unintentional. 
      Patients who were older, male, nonwhite, and who had no insurance were more 
      likely to have unintentional overdoses. Opiates and heroin were most commonly 
      present in unintentional overdoses, whereas benzodiazepines and sedatives were 
      more common in intentional overdoses. Patients living in census tracts with a 
      higher percentage of residents with some college also had a higher rate of 
      unintentional overdose. Rates of overdose at the census tract level varied and 
      were higher in tracts with lower median income, low income inequality ratio, high 
      percentage of college attendance, and higher percentage of nonwhite residents. 
      The average charge per overdose was $14,771 (median = $9,497) and totaled 
      $6,188,923 for the year. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides demographic, 
      geographic, and socioeconomic detail about drug overdose in the community that 
      can be used to focus future treatment and prevention interventions.

TI  - Electronic problem lists: a thematic analysis of a systematic literature review 
      to identify aspects critical to success.
PG  - 603-613
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocy011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Problem list data is a driving force for many beneficial clinical 
      tools, yet these data remain underutilized. We performed a systematic literature 
      review, pulling insights from previous research, aggregating insights into 
      themes, and distilling themes into actionable advice. We sought to learn what 
      changes we could make to existing applications, to the clinical workflow, and to 
      clinicians' perceptions that would improve problem list utilization and increase 
      the prevalence of problems data in the electronic medical record. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses guidelines to systematically curate a corpus of pertinent articles. 
      We performed a thematic analysis, looking for interesting excerpts and ideas. By 
      aggregating excerpts from many authors, we gained broader, more inclusive 
      insights into what makes a good problem list and what factors are conducive to 
      its success. RESULTS: Analysis led to a list of 7 benefits of using the problem 
      list, 15 aspects critical to problem list success, and knowledge to help inform 
      policy development, such as consensus on what belongs on the problem list, who 
      should maintain the problem list, and when. CONCLUSIONS: A list of suggestions is 
      made on ways in which the problem list can be improved to increase utilization by 
      clinicians. There is also a need for standard measurements of the problem list, 
      so that lists can be measured, compared, and discussed with rigor and a common 
      vocabulary.

TI  - Moving From Problem-Oriented to Goal-Directed Health Records.
PG  - 155-159
LID - 10.1370/afm.2180 [doi]
AB  - Electronic health records (EHRs) have been in place for decades; however, most 
      existing systems were designed in the prevailing disease- and payment-focused 
      care paradigm that often loses sight of the goals, needs, and values of patients 
      and clinicians. The goal-directed health care model was proposed more than 20 
      years ago, but no design principles have been developed for corresponding 
      electronic record systems. Newly designed EHRs are needed to facilitate health 
      care that is anchored by patient life and health goals. We explore the 
      limitations of current EHRs and propose a blueprint for a new EHR design that may 
      facilitate goal-directed health care. To reflect patient goals as a thread 
      through the care continuum, we propose 5 major system functions for goal-directed 
      health records based on the 8 characteristics of primary health care defined by 
      the Institute of Medicine. We also discuss how new EHR functions could support 
      goal-directed health care and how payment and quality measurement systems will 
      need to be transformed. It may be possible for patient life and health goals to 
      drive health care that is reinforced by a corresponding health record design; 
      however, synchronized shifts must occur in the models of providing, documenting, 
      and paying for health care.

TI  - Impact of problem-based charting on the utilization and accuracy of the 
      electronic problem list.
PG  - 548-554
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocx154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Problem-based charting (PBC) is a method for clinician documentation 
      in commercially available electronic medical record systems that integrates note 
      writing and problem list management. We report the effect of PBC on problem list 
      utilization and accuracy at an academic intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: An interrupted time series design was used to assess the effect of PBC 
      on problem list utilization, which is defined as the number of new problems added 
      to the problem list by clinicians per patient encounter, and of problem list 
      accuracy, which was determined by calculating the recall and precision of the 
      problem list in capturing 5 common ICU diagnoses. RESULTS: In total, 3650 and 
      4344 patient records were identified before and after PBC implementation at 
      Stanford Hospital. An increase of 2.18 problems (>50% increase) in the mean 
      number of new problems added to the problem list per patient encounter can be 
      attributed to the initiation of PBC. There was a significant increase in recall 
      attributed to the initiation of PBC for sepsis (β = 0.45, P < .001) and acute 
      renal failure (β = 0.2, P = .007), but not for acute respiratory failure, 
      pneumonia, or venous thromboembolism. DISCUSSION: The problem list is an 
      underutilized component of the electronic medical record that can be a source of 
      clinician-structured data representing the patient's clinical condition in real 
      time. PBC is a readily available tool that can integrate problem list management 
      into physician workflow. CONCLUSION: PBC improved problem list utilization and 
      accuracy at an academic ICU.

TI  - Automatic Loading of Problems Using a Comorbidities Subset: One Step to Organize 
      and Maintain the Patient's Problem List.
PG  - 1358
AB  - An accurate and updated problems' list is critical in a problem-oriented 
      Electronic Health Record (EHR). The lack of organization and maintenance of the 
      problems limits its value. Certain problems have a larger effect on the clinical 
      evolution of the patient, these are known as Comorbidities. The aim of this paper 
      is to evaluate the impact of the automatic loading of comorbidities in the 
      organization and maintenance of inpatient problems' list using a comorbidities 
      subset.

TI  - Dynamic Electronic Health Record Note Prototype: Seeing More by Showing Less.
PG  - 691-700
LID - 10.3122/jabfm.2017.06.170028 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cluttered documentation may contribute adversely to physician 
      readers' cognitive load, inadvertently obscuring high-value information with less 
      valuable information. We test the hypothesis that a novel, collapsible 
      assessment, plan, subjective, objective (APSO) note design would be faster, more 
      accurate, and more satisfying to use than a conventional electronic health record 
      (EHR) subjective, objective, assessment, plan (SOAP) note for finding information 
      needed for ambulatory chronic disease care. METHODS: We iteratively developed 
      physician clinic note prototypes with features designed to emphasize more 
      important information and de-emphasize less clinically relevant information. 
      Sixteen primary care physicians reviewed comparable clinic notes with the 4 note 
      styles presented in random order to find key information in the notes during 
      timed tasks. The 4 note styles were denoted A (traditional SOAP note), B 
      (2-column APSO note), C (collapsible APSO note), and D (2-column collapsible APSO 
      note). The 4 unique note styles were designed to have equal amounts of 
      information in each section. We simulated their utility for clinical practice by 
      imposing time limits and by interrupting 1 of the tasks with a typical clinical 
      interruption. For each session, we recorded audio, computer-screen activity, eye 
      tracking, and made field notes. We obtained usability ratings (System Usability 
      Scale), new feature preference ratings, and performed semistructured post-task 
      interviews with subsequent content analysis. We compared the effectiveness of the 
      4 note styles by measuring time on task, task success (accuracy), and effort as 
      measured by NASA Task Load Index. RESULTS: Note styles C and D were significantly 
      faster than A and B for the Review of Systems and Physical Examination tasks, as 
      we expected. Notes B and C had the best success (finding requested data) scores. 
      Users strongly endorsed all the new note features incorporated into the new note 
      prototypes. Previously expressed concerns about temporarily hiding parts of the 
      note (using the accordion display design pattern) were allayed. Usability ratings 
      for note A were worst but comparably better for note styles B, C, and D. 
      DISCUSSION: The new APSO note prototypes performed better than the traditional 
      SOAP note format for speed, task success (accuracy), and usability for physician 
      users acquiring information needed for a typical chronic disease visit in primary 
      care. Moving Assessment and Plan to the top is 1 easily accomplished feature 
      change. Innovative documentation displays of EHR data can safely improve 
      information display without eliminating data from the record of the visit.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate a sample of electronic 
      medical records (EMR) that was sufficiently representative of the different areas 
      of care in a university hospital, as well as to verify the effectiveness of an 
      initial intervention through a second evaluation. METHODS: Medical records audits 
      were performed in 2012 and 2013 by a blind peer review of random samples of care 
      episodes, proportional to the activity of each clinical department, and with the 
      same evaluation method being applied to all of them. RESULTS: More than 1,000 
      episodes of care were reviewed in the 2audits. A significant improvement was 
      found in hospital admissions (P=.000) in all the sections of the EMR analysed 
      (P=.002), and was especially significant for the reason for consultation, for 
      which its completion increased by 8.5% (p<.05), and also in the sections of the 
      current process record (7.1%), physical examination (4.7%), allergies (3.9%), and 
      clinical course (3.6%). The assessment of the discharge report, as a whole, 
      showed an improvement (P=.001). In outpatient follow-up visits, a significant 
      positive improvement was observed in the 4sections evaluated (P<.05), and also 
      overall (P=.000). CONCLUSIONS: According to study conditions, the dissemination 
      of the results was effective in improving the quality of the EMR. The results 
      have made it possible to implement actions to review the work processes in 
      certain departments, and also the partial redesign of the interface on being a 
      reproducible methodology accepted by the organisation.

TI  - Towards an overarching model for electronic medical-record systems, including 
      problem-oriented, goal-oriented, and other approaches.

AB  - There is no consensus among health professionals on how to structure medical 
      records to serve clinical decision-making. Three approaches co-exist 
      (source-oriented, problem-oriented, goal-oriented), each suiting a different 
      subset of patients. In primary care, the problem-oriented approach is dominant, 
      but for patients with multiple conditions (multimorbidity) the goal-oriented 
      approach seems more appropriate. There is a need to combine different approaches 
      in one medical-record system. In this article, we explain some misconceptions 
      about 'problems' and 'goals' that hinder the way to consensus. When putting the 
      approaches into historical perspective, it becomes evident that each relates to a 
      different definition of health. Each approach has its specific merits that should 
      be preserved even when health definitions change. Hence, we combine the merits of 
      each approach into one overarching model, as to show the way to a new generation 
      of electronic medical-record systems that can serve all patients. This model has 
      three levels: a level of problems, diseases, and patient goals, a level of 
      (shared) objectives, and a level of action plans and results.

TI  - Rendering Problem-Oriented CCD for chronic diseases.
PG  - 4277-4280

AB  - Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based clinical document standard 
      designed to ensure data exchange as well as semantic interoperability of 
      healthcare information systems. Continuity care of documents (CCD), a template 
      derived from CDA, is designed with the goal of displaying patient records more 
      intuitively for clinicians, especially for when the patient has a long history of 
      medical care.The rate of chronic patients in the general population has increased 
      as longevity has increased substantially in the past few decades, and the trend 
      towards longer and more complex medical records has made it time-consuming to 
      read patient data even in the CCD document. The problem-oriented medical record 
      (POMR) is an easily readable medical record style and it has been widely adopted 
      in electronic health record (EHR) services in Europe. Unfortunately, POMR has not 
      been integrated with the CCD-compatible representation so far. Hence this paper 
      proposes Problem-Oriented CCD (PO-CCD) rendering based on CDA and POMR. To find 
      out how a PO-CCD would be viewed by healthcare professionals and healthcare IT 
      professionals, we drafted a few Problem-oriented CCD example documents and 
      conducted a survey on their impression. Among our 41 respondents, 60% replied 
      they would like to view patient charts in our Problem-Oriented CCD rendering 
      side-by-side with the conventional CCD rather than the conventional CCD alone.

      Clinical Outcomes and Revision Rates Following Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
      Reconstruction.
PG  - 834-844
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2017.7048 [doi]
AB  - Study Design Retrospective cohort from the Intermountain Healthcare system, 
      January 2007 to December 2014. Background Recent evolutions in health care 
      delivery are putting physical therapists in the forefront to be more responsible 
      for providing high-quality rehabilitation care in a more cost-effective manner. 
      Studies investigating the association between physical therapy visit utilization 
      and outcomes in vulnerable patient populations following anterior cruciate 
      ligament (ACL) reconstruction may provide useful insights. Objectives To examine 
      the relationship between patient age, sex, physical therapy visit utilization, 
      and physical therapy intervention charges with revision rates and 
      patient-reported outcomes in individuals following primary ACL reconstruction. 
      Methods A sample of 660 patients who had an ACL reconstruction was identified 
      through an electronic medical record database. Age and physical therapy visit 
      utilization were categorized to examine effects between groups (20 years of age 
      or younger, 21 to 34 years of age, 35 years of age or older; fewer than 9 visits, 
      9 to 14 visits, 15 or more visits). Multilevel mixed-effects linear models were 
      conducted to compare differences between revision rates and patient-reported 
      outcomes during the episode of care. Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analyses were also used to determine visit-number and charge-per-visit cut points 
      to discriminate patients who achieved at least a minimal clinically important 
      difference on the patient-reported outcomes. Results Of 660 patients, 22 (3.3%) 
      had revision surgery. Compared with patients 20 years and younger, the incidence 
      rate ratio of ACL reconstruction revision was lower in patients who were 35 years 
      and older (85%) and 21 to 34 years (59%). Of 470 patients who attended physical 
      therapy for longer than 3 months, change in Knee Outcome Survey activities of 
      daily living subscale score was significantly lower among patients 20 years of 
      age and younger and in the lowest visit category. Conclusion Achievement of 
      favorable outcomes following ACL reconstruction may require categorization of 
      patients beyond surgical diagnosis alone. Younger patients (aged 20 years or 
      less) attending fewer physical therapy visits (fewer than 9) were more likely to 
      have ACL revision surgery and had inferior patient-reported outcomes compared to 
      older patients and those with higher physical therapy visit utilization. The 
      study design of a retrospective cohort limits the ability to identify causal 
      relationships. Additionally, this study was conducted in only 1 geographic region 
      within a single health care delivery system, which may limit the generalizability 
      of the results. Level of Evidence Prognosis, level 2c. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther

PG  - 1351-1357
LID - 10.1017/ice.2017.208 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection 
      (RCDI) on patient behaviors following illness. METHODS Using a computer 
      algorithm, we searched the electronic medical records of 7 Chicago-area hospitals 
      to identify patients with RCDI (2 episodes of CDI within 15 to 56 days of each 
      other). RCDI was validated by medical record review. Patients were asked to 
      complete a telephone survey. The survey included questions regarding general 
      health, social isolation, symptom severity, emotional distress, and prevention 
      behaviors. RESULTS In total, 119 patients completed the survey (32%). On average, 
      respondents were 57.4 years old (standard deviation, 16.8); 57% were white, and 
      ~50% reported hospitalization for CDI. At the time of their most recent illness, 
      patients rated their diarrhea as high severity (58.5%) and their exhaustion as 
      extreme (30.7%). Respondents indicated that they were very worried about getting 
      sick again (41.5%) and about infecting others (31%). Almost 50% said that they 
      have washed their hands more frequently (47%) and have increased their use of 
      soap and water (45%) since their illness. Some of these patients (22%-32%) 
      reported eating out less, avoiding certain medications and public areas, and 
      increasing probiotic use. Most behavioral changes were unrelated to disease 
      severity. CONCLUSION Having had RCDI appears to increase prevention-related 
      behaviors in some patients. While some behaviors are appropriate (eg, 
      handwashing), others are not supported by evidence of decreased risk and may 
      negatively impact patient quality of life. Providers should discuss appropriate 
      prevention behaviors with their patients and should clarify that other behaviors 
      (eg, eating out less) will not affect their risk of future illness. Infect 
      Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2017;38:1351-1357.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: An accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date problem list can help 
      clinicians provide patient-centered care. Unfortunately, problem lists created 
      and maintained in electronic health records by providers tend to be inaccurate, 
      duplicative and out of date. With advances in machine learning and natural 
      language processing, it is possible to automatically generate a problem list from 
      the data in the EHR and keep it current. In this paper, we describe an automated 
      problem list generation method and report on insights from a pilot study of 
      physicians' assessment of the generated problem lists compared to existing 
      providers-curated problem lists in an institution's EHR system. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The natural language processing and machine learning-based Watson(1) 
      method models clinical thinking in identifying a patient's problem list using 
      clinical notes and structured data. This pilot study assessed the Watson method 
      and included 15 randomly selected, de-identified patient records from a large 
      healthcare system that were each planned to be reviewed by at least two internal 
      medicine physicians. The physicians created their own problem lists, and then 
      evaluated the overall usefulness of their own problem lists (P), Watson generated 
      problem lists (W), and the existing EHR problem lists (E) on a 10-point scale. 
      The primary outcome was pairwise comparisons of P, W, and E. RESULTS: Six out of 
      the 10 invited physicians completed 27 assessments of P, W, and E, and in process 
      evaluated 732 Watson generated problems and 444 problems in the EHR system. As 
      expected, physicians rated their own lists, P, highest. However, W was rated 
      higher than E. Among 89% of assessments, Watson identified at least one important 
      problem that physicians missed. CONCLUSION: Cognitive computing systems like this 
      Watson system hold the potential for accurate, problem-list-centered 
      summarization of patient records, potentially leading to increased efficiency, 
      better clinical decision support, and improved quality of patient care.

      service users with a diagnosis of psychosis were recorded as having received CBTp 
      within their episode of care during defined time periods provided by early 
      intervention or promoting recovery community services for people with psychosis, 
      compared with published audits and whether demographic characteristics 
      differentially predicted the receipt of CBTp. METHODS: Both free text using 
      natural language processing (NLP) techniques and structured methods of 
      identifying CBTp were combined and evaluated for positive predictive value (PPV) 
      and sensitivity. Using inclusion criteria from two published audits, we 
      identified anonymised cross-sectional samples of 2579 and 2308 service users 
      respectively with a case note diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis for further 
      analysis. RESULTS: The method achieved PPV of 95% and sensitivity of 96%. Using 
      the National Audit of Schizophrenia 2 criteria, 34.6% service users were 
      identified as ever having received at least one session and 26.4% at least two 
      sessions of CBTp; these are higher percentages than previously reported by manual 
      audit of a sample from the same trust that returned 20.0%. In the fully adjusted 
      analysis, CBTp receipt was significantly (p<0.05) more likely in younger 
      patients, in white and other when compared with black ethnic groups and patients 
      with a diagnosis of other schizophrenia spectrum and schizoaffective disorder 
      when compared with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: The methods presented here 
      provided a potential method for evaluating delivery of CBTp on a large scale, 
      providing more scope for routine monitoring, cross-site comparisons and the 
      promotion of equitable access.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternity patients interact with the healthcare system over an 
      approximately ten-month interval, requiring multiple visits, acquiring 
      pregnancy-specific education, and sharing health information among providers. 
      Many features of a web-based patient portal could help pregnant women manage 
      their interactions with the healthcare system; however, it is unclear whether 
      pregnant women in safety-net settings have the resources, skills or interest 
      required for portal adoption. OBJECTIVES: In this study of postpartum patients in 
      a safety net hospital, we aimed to: (1) determine if patients have the technical 
      resources and skills to access a portal, (2) gain insight into their interest in 
      health information, and (3) identify the perceived utility of portal features and 
      potential barriers to adoption. METHODS: We developed a structured questionnaire 
      to collect demographics from postpartum patients and measure use of technology 
      and the internet, self-reported literacy, interest in health information, 
      awareness of portal functions, and perceived barriers to use. The questionnaire 
      was administered in person to women in an inpatient setting. RESULTS: Of the 100 
      participants surveyed, 95% reported routine internet use and 56% used it to 
      search for health information. Most participants had never heard of a patient 
      portal, yet 92% believed that the portal functions were important. The two most 
      appealing functions were to check results and manage appointments. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Most participants in this study have the required resources such as a device and 
      familiarity with the internet to access a patient portal including an interest in 
      interacting with a healthcare institution via electronic means. Pregnancy is a 
      critical episode of care where active engagement with the healthcare system can 
      influence outcomes. Healthcare systems and portal developers should consider ways 
      to tailor a portal to address the specific health needs of a maternity population 
      including those in a safety net setting.

TI  - Process mining routinely collected electronic health records to define real-life 
      clinical pathways during chemotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of routinely collected 
      electronic health records to enhance service delivery and facilitate clinical 
      research. It should be possible to detect and measure patterns of care and use 
      the data to monitor improvements but there are methodological and data quality 
      challenges. Driven by the desire to model the impact of a patient self-test blood 
      count monitoring service in patients on chemotherapy, we aimed to (i) establish 
      reproducible methods of process-mining electronic health records, (ii) use the 
      outputs derived to define and quantify patient pathways during chemotherapy, and 
      (iii) to gather robust data which is structured to be able to inform a 
      cost-effectiveness decision model of home monitoring of neutropenic status during 
      chemotherapy. METHODS: Electronic Health Records at a UK oncology centre were 
      included if they had (i) a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and received 
      adjuvant epirubicin and cyclosphosphamide chemotherapy or (ii) colorectal cancer 
      and received palliative oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy, 
      and (iii) were first diagnosed with cancer between January 2004 and February 
      2013. Software and a Markov model were developed, producing a schematic of 
      patient pathways during chemotherapy. RESULTS: Significant variance from the 
      assumed care pathway was evident from the data. Of the 535 patients with breast 
      cancer and 420 with colorectal cancer there were 474 and 329 pathway variants 
      respectively. Only 27 (5%) and 26 (6%) completed the planned six cycles of 
      chemotherapy without having unplanned hospital contact. Over the six cycles, 169 
      (31.6%) patients with breast cancer and 190 (45.2%) patients with colorectal 
      cancer were admitted to hospital. CONCLUSION: The pathways of patients on 
      chemotherapy are complex. An iterative approach to addressing semantic and data 
      quality issues enabled the effective use of routinely collected patient records 
      to produce accurate models of the real-life experiences of chemotherapy patients 
      and generate clinically useful information. Very few patients experience the 
      idealised patient pathway that is used to plan their care. A better understanding 
      of real-life clinical pathways through process mining can contribute to care and 
      data quality assurance, identifying unmet needs, facilitating quantification of 
      innovation impact, communicating with stakeholders, and ultimately improving 
      patient care and outcomes.

TI  - A hospital-wide transition from paper to digital problem-oriented clinical notes. 
      A descriptive history and cross-sectional survey of use, usability, and 
      satisfaction.
PG  - 502-514
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2016-08-RA-0137 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the use, usability, and physician satisfaction of a 
      locally developed problem-oriented clinical notes application that replaced 
      paper-based records in a large Dutch university medical center. METHODS: Using a 
      clinical notes database and an application event log file and a cross-sectional 
      survey of usability, authors retrospectively analyzed system usage for medical 
      specialties, users, and patients over 4 years. A standardized questionnaire 
      measured usability. Authors analyzed the effects of sex, age, professional 
      experience, training hours, and medical specialty on user satisfaction via 
      univariate analysis of variance. Authors also examined the correlation between 
      user satisfaction in relation to users' intensity of use of the application. 
      RESULTS: In total 1,793 physicians used the application to record progress notes 
      for 219,755 patients. The overall satisfaction score was 3.2 on a scale from 1 
      (highly dissatisfied) to 5 (highly satisfied). A statistically significant 
      difference occurred in satisfaction by medical specialty, but no statistically 
      significant differences in satisfaction took place by sex, age, professional 
      experience, or training hours. Intensity of system use did not correlate with 
      physician satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: By two years after the start of the 
      implementation, all medical specialties utilized the clinical notes application. 
      User satisfaction was neutral (3.2 on a 1-5 scale). Authors believe that the 
      significant factors facilitating this transition mirrored success factors 
      reported by other groups: a generic, consistent, and transparent design of the 
      application; intensive collaboration; continuous monitoring; and an incremental 
      rollout.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a Case-Based Retrieval Service.
PG  - 186-190
AB  - Identifying similar patients might greatly facilitate the treatment of a given 
      patient, enabling to observe the response and outcome to a particular treatment. 
      Case-based retrieval services dealing with natural language processing are of 
      major importance to deal with the significant amount of unstructured clinical 
      data. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of a case-based 
      retrieval (CBR) service tested on a collection of Italian pediatric cardiology 
      cases. Cases are indexed and a search engine is proposed. Search functionalities, 
      such as interactive MeSH normalization and relevance feedback, are proposed. 
      While the qualitative evaluation aims to provide feedback and recommendations, 
      the quantitative evaluation enables to estimate the precision of the system. In 
      more than half of the cases and for up to two thirds of them, the system is able 
      to suggest a similar episode of care at first rank. With an improvement of the 
      feedback relevance strategy, we can expect an improvement of the precision. The 
      CBR can be expanded to multilingual EHR and other fields.

      health information technology.
PG  - 155-171
LID - 10.1080/01621424.2016.1264340 [doi]
AB  - In the United States, home care clinicians often start the episode of care devoid 
      of relevant fall-risk information. By collecting and analyzing qualitative data 
      from 30 clinicians in one home health agency, this case study aimed to understand 
      how the currently adopted information technology solutions supported the 
      clinicians' fall-risk management (FRM) information domains, and explored 
      opportunities to adopt other solutions to better support FRM. The currently 
      adopted electronic health record system and fall-reporting application served 
      only some information domains with a limited capacity. Substantial improvement in 
      addressing the FRM information domains is possible by effectively modifying the 
      existing solutions and purposefully adopting new solutions.

TI  - Turning Electromyography Reports Upside Down: A Pilot Study Surveying Referring 
      Providers.
PG  - 1-3
AB  - Providers are expressing a desire for more efficient ways to retrieve relevant 
      clinical data from the Electronic Health Record. In an effort to improve our 
      Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Study reports, we surveyed referring 
      providers on the effects of having the IMPRESSION at the start of the report. Our 
      survey respondents felt that using this format for an Electromyography and Nerve 
      Conduction Study report significantly improved the quality of the report while 
      saving them time and/or mouse clicks when interpreting the report. Electro 
      diagnosticians might consider using this format for their Electromyography and 
      Nerve Conduction Study reports to improve referring provider satisfaction.

TI  - Antibiotic Treatment for First Episode of Acute Otitis Media Is Not Associated 
      with Future Recurrences.
PG  - e0160560
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0160560 [doi]
LID - e0160560
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) has been suggested to 
      increase the risk of future AOM episodes by causing unfavorable shifts in 
      microbial flora. Because current evidence on this topic is inconclusive and 
      long-term follow-up data are scarce, we wanted to estimate the effect of 
      antibiotic treatment for a first AOM episode occurring during infancy on AOM 
      recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization later in life. METHODS: We 
      obtained demographic information and risk factors from data of the Wheezing 
      Illnesses Study Leidsche Rijn, a prospective birth cohort study in which all 
      healthy newborns born in Leidsche Rijn (between 2001 and 2012), The Netherlands, 
      were enrolled. These data were linked to children's primary care electronic 
      health records up to the age of four. Children with at least one family 
      physician-diagnosed AOM episode before the age of two were included in analyses. 
      The exposure of interest was the prescription of oral antibiotics (yes vs no) for 
      a child's first AOM episode before the age of two years. RESULTS: 848 children 
      were included in analyses and 512 (60%) children were prescribed antibiotics for 
      their first AOM episode. Antibiotic treatment was not associated with an 
      increased risk of total AOM recurrences (adjusted rate ratio: 0.94, 95% CI: 
      0.78-1.13), recurrent AOM (≥3 episodes in 6 months or ≥4 in one year; adjusted 
      risk ratio: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.57-1.11), or with increased AOM-related health care 
      utilization during children's first four years of life. CONCLUSIONS: Oral 
      antibiotic treatment of a first AOM episode occurring during infancy does not 
      affect the number of AOM recurrences and AOM-related health care utilization 
      later in life. This information can be used when weighing the pros and cons of 
      various AOM treatment options.

TI  - The Use of Evidence-Based, Problem-Oriented Templates as a Clinical Decision 
      Support in an Inpatient Electronic Health Record System.
PG  - 790-802
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2015-11-RA-0164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The integration of clinical decision support (CDS) in documentation 
      practices remains limited due to obstacles in provider workflows and design 
      restrictions in electronic health records (EHRs). The use of electronic 
      problem-oriented templates (POTs) as a CDS has been previously discussed but not 
      widely studied. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the voluntary use of evidence-based POTs 
      as a CDS on documentation practices. METHODS: This was a randomized cohort 
      (before and after) study of Hospitalist Attendings in an Academic Medical Center 
      using EPIC EHRs. Primary Outcome measurement was note quality, assessed by the 
      9-item Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI-9). Secondary Outcome 
      measurement was physician efficiency, assessed by the total charting time per 
      note. RESULTS: Use of POTs increased the quality of note documentation [score 
      37.5 vs. 39.0, P = 0.0020]. The benefits of POTs scaled with use; the greatest 
      improvement in note quality was found in notes using three or more POTs [score 
      40.2, P = 0.0262]. There was no significant difference in total charting time [30 
      minutes vs. 27 minutes, P = 0.42]. CONCLUSION: Use of evidence-based and 
      problem-oriented templates is associated with improved note quality without 
      significant change in total charting time. It can be used as an effective CDS 
      during note documentation.

TI  - Missing the mark: ongoing missed opportunities for HIV diagnosis at an urban 
      medical center despite universal screening recommendations.
PG  - 644-648
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite established recommendations from the Centers for Disease 
      Control (CDC) to scale up testing efforts in the USA, this study shows full scale 
      implementation of these recommendations may still be lacking. We hypothesize that 
      patients experience ongoing missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis of HIV, 
      despite frequent encounters to Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), an integrated 
      hospital system in the Bronx, NY. METHODS: Retrospective chart review via 
      electronic medical records of patients newly diagnosed with HIV in 2012 and 2013 
      at varied MMC clinical sites. Missed opportunities were defined as > 1 prior 
      health care encounter at MMC within three calendar years of diagnosis, in which 
      HIV testing was not offered for those who had a prior negative test or no prior 
      test. RESULTS: There were 218 patients newly diagnosed with HIV at MMC during the 
      study period; 31% presented with a CD4 <200 cells/mm(3); 22% were asymptomatic at 
      diagnosis. Patients (56%) without a prior HIV test had an average 4.72 clinical 
      encounters at MMC within the 3 years prior to their HIV diagnosis. Over 95% of 
      visits prior to diagnosis occurred in emergency departments (EDs) or primary care 
      outpatient department (OPDs) and accounted for the vast majority of missed 
      opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infected patients continue to present late to 
      care, with low CD4 and commonly utilize OPDs and EDs, where missed opportunities 
      for earlier diagnosis are common. Practices that address augmentation of current 
      HIV testing strategies are needed, especially in outpatient and first-contact 
      acute care settings.

TI  - Determinants of a successful problem list to support the implementation of the 
      problem-oriented medical record according to recent literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A problem-oriented approach is one of the possibilities to organize a 
      medical record. The problem-oriented medical record (POMR) - a structured 
      organization of patient information per presented medical problem- was introduced 
      at the end of the sixties by Dr. Lawrence Weed to aid dealing with the 
      multiplicity of patient problems. The problem list as a precondition is the 
      centerpiece of the problem-oriented medical record (POMR) also called 
      problem-oriented record (POR). Prior to the digital era, paper records presented 
      a flat list of medical problems to the healthcare professional without the 
      features that are possible with current technology. In modern EHRs a POMR based 
      on a structured problem list can be used for clinical decision support, 
      registries, order management, population health, and potentially other innovative 
      functionality in the future, thereby providing a new incentive to the 
      implementation and use of the POMR. METHODS: On both 12 May 2014 and 1 June 2015 
      a systematic literature search was conducted. From the retrieved articles 
      statements regarding the POMR and related to successful or non-successful 
      implementation, were categorized. Generic determinants were extracted from these 
      statements. RESULTS: In this research 38 articles were included. The literature 
      analysis led to 12 generic determinants: clinical practice/reasoning, complete 
      and accurate problem list, data structure/content, efficiency, functionality, 
      interoperability, multi-disciplinary, overview of patient information, quality of 
      care, system support, training of staff, and usability. CONCLUSIONS: Two main 
      subjects can be distinguished in the determinants: the system that the problem 
      list and POMR is integrated in and the organization using that system. The 
      combination of the two requires a sociotechnical approach and both are equally 
      important for successful implementation of a POMR. All the determinants have to 
      be taken into account, but the weight given to each of the determinants depends 
      on the organizationusing the problem list or POMR.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Complete patient problem lists may improve the quality of care. To 
      improve the completeness of the lists at our institution, we implemented the 
      coded problem list entry subsystem (CPLES) in our electronic medical record 
      system. Subsequently, physicians used the CPLES instead of handwritten notes to 
      document coded problem lists and progress notes. We evaluated the effect of 
      implementing the CPLES on the completeness of problem lists. METHODS: We compared 
      the completeness of coded problem lists input after CPLES implementation with 
      that of problem lists handwritten before CPLES implementation and determined the 
      differences. Moreover, the efficiency and usability of the CPLES were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: The efficiency and usability of CPLES were acceptable. However, the 
      completeness of problem lists was reduced after CPLES implementation. The 
      possible reasons for this reduction, namely system usability, efficacy, 
      incentives, leadership, and education, were crucial for successful CPLES 
      implementation and are discussed in the text. CONCLUSION: CPLES implementation 
      reduced the completeness of problem lists. Institutions may learn from our 
      experience and carefully implement their own coded problem list systems to avoid 
      this consequence.

TI  - Evaluation of the delirium early monitoring system (DEMS).
PG  - 1879-1887
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite awareness of the negative health and financial outcomes of 
      delirium, systems to routinely assess and manage the condition are absent in 
      clinical practice. We report the development and pilot evaluation of a Delirium 
      Early Monitoring System (DEMS), designed to be completed by non-medical staff to 
      influence clinical processes within inpatient settings. Two versions of the DEMS 
      are described based on a modified Confusion Assessment Method (DEMS-CAM) and 
      Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DEMS-DOSS). METHODS: Both versions of DEMS 
      were piloted on a 20-bedded Psychogeriatric ward over 6 weeks. Training was 
      administered to ward staff on the use of each version of the DEMS and data were 
      collected via electronic medical records and completed assessment sheets. The 
      primary outcome was patterns of DEMS use and the secondary outcome was the 
      initiation of delirium management protocols. Data regarding the use of the DEMS 
      DOSS and DEMS CAMS were analyzed using χ 2 tests. RESULTS: Completion rates for 
      the DEMS CAM and DEMS DOSS were 79% and 68%, respectively. Non-medical staff were 
      significantly more likely to use the DEMS-CAM as part of daily practice as 
      opposed to the DEMS-DOSS (p<0.001). However, there was no difference between the 
      use of the DEMS-CAM and DEMS-DOSS in triggering related actions such as 
      documentation of assessment scores in patients' medical records and 
      implementation of delirium management protocols. CONCLUSIONS: This real world 
      evaluation revealed that non-medical staff were able to incorporate delirium 
      monitoring into their practice, on the majority of occasions, as part of their 
      daily working routine. Further research is necessary to determine if the routine 
      use of the DEMS can lead to improved understandings and practice of non-medical 
      staff regarding delirium detection.

TI  - Use of Electronic Health Records and Geographic Information Systems in Public 
      Health Surveillance of Type 2 Diabetes: A Feasibility Study.
PG  - e12
LID - 10.2196/publichealth.4319 [doi]
LID - e12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data routinely collected in electronic health records (EHRs) offer a 
      unique opportunity to monitor chronic health conditions in real-time. Geographic 
      information systems (GIS) may be an important complement in the analysis of those 
      data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of using 
      primary care EHRs and GIS for population care management and public health 
      surveillance of chronic conditions, in Portugal. Specifically, type 2 diabetes 
      was chosen as a case study, and we aimed to map its prevalence and the presence 
      of comorbidities, as well as to identify possible populations at risk for 
      cardiovascular complications. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using 
      individual-level data from 514 primary care centers, collected from three 
      different types of EHRs. Data were obtained on adult patients with type 2 
      diabetes (identified by the International Classification of Primary Care [ICPC-2] 
      code, T90, in the problems list). GISs were used for mapping the prevalence of 
      diabetes and comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity) by parish, 
      in the region of Lisbon and Tagus Valley. Descriptive statistics and multivariate 
      logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: We identified 205,068 
      individuals with the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, corresponding to a prevalence 
      of 5.6% (205,068/3,659,868) in the study population. The mean age of these 
      patients was 67.5 years, and hypertension was present in 71% (144,938/205,068) of 
      all individuals. There was considerable variation in diagnosed comorbidities 
      across parishes. Diabetes patients with concomitant hypertension or dyslipidemia 
      showed higher odds of having been diagnosed with cardiovascular complications, 
      when adjusting for age and gender (hypertension odds ratio [OR] 2.16, confidence 
      interval [CI] 2.10-2.22; dyslipidemia OR 1.57, CI 1.54-1.60). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Individual-level data from EHRs may play an important role in chronic disease 
      surveillance, namely through the use of GIS. Promoting the quality and 
      comprehensiveness of data, namely through patient involvement in their medical 
      records, is crucial to enhance the feasibility and usefulness of this approach.

TI  - Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes in Paediatric Oncology - Applying Mobile and 
      Near Field Communication Technology.
PG  - 281-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) gathered using 
      telemonitoring solutions might be a valuable source of information in rare cancer 
      research. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper was to develop a concept and 
      implement a prototype for introducing ePRO into the existing neuroblastoma 
      research network by applying Near Field Communication and mobile technology. 
      METHODS: For physicians, an application was developed for registering patients 
      within the research network and providing patients with an ID card and a PIN for 
      authentication when transmitting telemonitoring data to the Electronic Data 
      Capture system OpenClinica. For patients, a previously developed telemonitoring 
      system was extended by a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) interface for 
      transmitting nine different health parameters and toxicities. RESULTS: The 
      concept was fully implemented on the front-end side. The developed application 
      for physicians was prototypically implemented and the mobile application of the 
      telemonitoring system was successfully connected to OpenClinica. Future work will 
      focus on the implementation of the back-end features.

TI  - Data quality of electronic medical records in Manitoba: do problem lists 
      accurately reflect chronic disease billing diagnoses?
PG  - 1107-1112
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocw013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine problem list completeness related to chronic diseases in 
      electronic medical records (EMRs) and explore clinic and physician factors 
      influencing completeness. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of primary care EMR 
      data quality related to seven chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, 
      congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disorder) in Manitoba, Canada. We included 119 practices in 
      18 primary care clinics across urban and rural Manitoba. The main outcome measure 
      was EMR problem list completeness. Completeness was measured by comparing the 
      number of EMR-documented diagnoses to the number of billings associated with each 
      disease. We calculated odds ratios for the effect of clinic patient load and 
      salary type on EMR problem list completeness of the 7 chronic diseases. RESULTS: 
      Completeness of EMR problem list for each disease varied widely among clinics. 
      Factors that significantly affected EMR problem list completeness included the 
      primary care provider, the patient load, and the clinic's funding and 
      organization model (ie, salaried, fee-for-service, or residency training 
      clinics). Average rates of completeness were: hypertension, 72%; diabetes, 80%; 
      hypothyroidism, 63%; asthma, 56%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, 43%; 
      congestive heart failure, 54%; and coronary artery disease, 64%. CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrates the high variability but generally low quality of problem 
      lists (health condition records) related to 7 common chronic diseases in EMRs. 
      There are systematic physician- and clinic-level factors associated with low data 
      quality completeness. This information may be useful to support improvement in 
      EMR data quality in primary care.

TI  - Patient question set proliferation: scope and informatics challenges of patient 
      question set management in a large multispecialty practice with case examples 
      pertaining to tobacco use, menopause, and Urology and Orthopedics specialties.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care institutions have patient question sets that can expand 
      over time. For a multispecialty group, each specialty might have multiple 
      question sets. As a result, question set governance can be challenging. Knowledge 
      of the counts, variability and repetition of questions in a multispecialty 
      practice can help institutions understand the challenges of question set 
      proliferation. METHODS: We analyzed patient-facing question sets that were 
      subject to institutional governance and those that were not. We examined question 
      variability and number of repetitious questions for a simulated episode of care. 
      In addition to examining general patient question sets, we used specific examples 
      of tobacco questions, questions from two specialty areas, and questions to 
      menopausal women. RESULTS: In our analysis, there were approximately 269 
      institutionally governed patient question sets with a mean of 74 questions per 
      set accounting for an estimated 20,000 governed questions. Sampling from selected 
      specialties revealed that 50 % of patient question sets were not institutionally 
      governed. We found over 650 tobacco-related questions in use, many with only 
      slight variations. A simulated use case for a menopausal woman revealed 
      potentially over 200 repeated questions. CONCLUSIONS: A group practice with 
      multiple specialties can have a large volume of patient questions that are not 
      centrally developed, stored or governed. This results in a lack of 
      standardization and coordination. Patients may be given multiple repeated 
      questions throughout the course of their care, and providers lack standardized 
      question sets to help construct valid patient phenotypes. Even with the 
      implementation of a single electronic health record, medical practices may still 
      have a health information management gap in the ability to create, store and 
      share patient-generated health information that is meaningful to both patients 
      and physicians.

TI  - Is the problem list in the eye of the beholder? An exploration of consistency 
      across physicians.
PG  - 859-65
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Quantify the variability of patients' problem lists - in terms of the 
      number, type, and ordering of problems - across multiple physicians and assess 
      physicians' criteria for organizing and ranking diagnoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      In an experimental setting, 32 primary care physicians generated and ordered 
      problem lists for three identical complex internal medicine cases expressed as 
      detailed 2- to 4-page abstracts and subsequently expressed their criteria for 
      ordering items in the list. We studied variability in problem list length. We 
      modified a previously validated rank-based similarity measure, with range of zero 
      to one, to quantify agreement between pairs of lists and calculate a single 
      consensus problem list that maximizes agreement with each physician. Physicians' 
      reasoning for the ordering of the problem lists was recorded. RESULTS: Subjects' 
      problem lists were highly variable. The median problem list length was 8 (range: 
      3-14) for Case A, 10 (range: 4-20) for Case B, and 7 (range: 3-13) for Case C. 
      The median indices of agreement - taking into account the length, content, and 
      order of lists - over all possible physician pairings was 0.479, 0.371, 0.509, 
      for Cases A, B, and C, respectively. The median agreements between the 
      physicians' lists and the consensus list for each case were 0.683, 0.581, and 
      0.697 (for Cases A, B, and C, respectively).Out of a possible 1488 pairings, 2 
      lists were identical. Physicians most frequently ranked problem list items based 
      on their acuity and immediate threat to health. CONCLUSIONS: The problem list is 
      a physician's mental model of a patient's health status. These mental models were 
      found to vary significantly between physicians, raising questions about whether 
      problem lists created by individual physicians can serve their intended purpose 
      to improve care coordination.

      Finland.
PG  - 283-90
LID - 10.3109/02813432.2015.1114352 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore patient characteristics, resource use, and costs related to 
      different episodes of care (EOC) in Finnish health care. DESIGN: Data were 
      collected during a three-month prospective, non-randomized follow-up study 
      (Effective Health Centre) using questionnaires and an electronic health record. 
      SETTING: Three primary health care practices in Pirkanmaa, Finland. SUBJECTS: 
      Altogether 622 patients were recruited during a one-week period. Inclusion 
      criteria: the patient had a doctor's or nurse's appointment on the recruiting day 
      and agreed to participate. Exclusion criteria: patients visiting a specialized 
      health guidance clinic for pregnant women, children, and mothers. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Patient characteristics, resource use, and costs based on the ICPC-2 
      EOC classification. RESULTS: On average, the patients had 1.22 EOCs during the 
      three months. Patient characteristics and resource use differed between the EOC 
      chapters. Chapter L, "Musculoskeletal", had the most episodes (17%). The most 
      common (8%) single EOC was "upper respiratory infection". The mean cost of an 
      episode (COE) was €389.56 (standard error 61.11) and the median COE was €165.00 
      (interquartile range €118.46-288.56) during the three-month follow-up. The most 
      expensive chapter was K, "Circulatory", with a mean COE of €909.85. The most 
      expensive single COE was in chapter K, €32 545.56. The most expensive 1% of the 
      COEs summed up covered 36% of the total COEs. CONCLUSION: Patient 
      characteristics, resource use, and costs differed between the ICPC-2 chapters, 
      which could be taken into account in service planning and pricing. Future studies 
      should incorporate more specific diagnoses, larger data sets, and longer 
      follow-up times. Key points The most common episodes were under the ICPC-2 
      "Musculoskeletal" chapter, but the highest mean and single-episode costs were 
      related to the "Circulatory" chapter. The mean (median) cost of episodes that 
      started in primary care was €390 (€165) during the three-month follow-up. Patient 
      characteristics, resource use, and costs differed significantly between the 
      ICPC-2 chapters. The most expensive 1% of the episodes covered 36% of the total 
      costs of all the episodes.

      chronic kidney disease.
PG  - 851-9
LID - 10.1111/nep.12676 [doi]
AB  - AIM: No evidence-based approach to the evaluation of CKD has been established. We 
      sought to identify clinical criteria to guide a rational diagnostic approach for 
      the initial evaluation of CKD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study 
      of 1487 patients presenting for initial evaluation of CKD over 3 years 
      (1/2010-1/2013) to academic nephrology clinics. We utilized the electronic 
      medical record to determine tests ordered, abnormal results and testing that 
      affected diagnosis and/or management. Diagnostic and management yield of testing 
      was defined as the percentage of tests that affected diagnosis and/or management. 
      High yield for a given test was defined as an increased likelihood of the test 
      affecting diagnosis and/or management. RESULTS: We identified clinical criteria 
      predictive of high yield for paraprotein-related testing (one of the following: 
      history of monoclonal disease, high risk of CKD progression, hypercalcemia or 
      haemoglobin < 10.6), and clinical criteria predictive of high yield for 
      glomerulonephritis testing (one of the following: abnormal urine sediment, 3+ or 
      greater hematuria or proteinuria > 500 mg/gm). A prior history of hydronephrosis 
      and renal artery stenosis was predictive of high yield of abnormal renal 
      ultrasound. Higher yield of testing was associated with higher risk progression 
      categories for ANA, SPEP, urine sediment, calcium, PTH, haemoglobin, iron and 
      ferritin. We estimate that initial CKD evaluation costs range from $28 to $109 
      million/year in US-Medicare expenditure. CONCLUSION: Numerous tests without 
      significant clinical utility are obtained in initial CKD evaluation. Identifying 
      criteria that can guide diagnostic testing may lead to a more informed and 
      cost-effective approach to evaluation.

TI  - Combining billing codes, clinical notes, and medications from electronic health 
      records provides superior phenotyping performance.
PG  - e20-7
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocv130 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the phenotyping performance of three major electronic 
      health record (EHR) components: International Classification of Disease (ICD) 
      diagnosis codes, primary notes, and specific medications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      We conducted the evaluation using de-identified Vanderbilt EHR data. We 
      preselected ten diseases: atrial fibrillation, Alzheimer's disease, breast 
      cancer, gout, human immunodeficiency virus infection, multiple sclerosis, 
      Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. 
      For each disease, patients were classified into seven categories based on the 
      presence of evidence in diagnosis codes, primary notes, and specific medications. 
      Twenty-five patients per disease category (a total number of 175 patients for 
      each disease, 1750 patients for all ten diseases) were randomly selected for 
      manual chart review. Review results were used to estimate the positive predictive 
      value (PPV), sensitivity, andF-score for each EHR component alone and in 
      combination. RESULTS: The PPVs of single components were inconsistent and 
      inadequate for accurately phenotyping (0.06-0.71). Using two or more ICD codes 
      improved the average PPV to 0.84. We observed a more stable and higher accuracy 
      when using at least two components (mean ± standard deviation: 0.91 ± 0.08). 
      Primary notes offered the best sensitivity (0.77). The sensitivity of ICD codes 
      was 0.67. Again, two or more components provided a reasonably high and stable 
      sensitivity (0.59 ± 0.16). Overall, the best performance (Fscore: 0.70 ± 0.12) 
      was achieved by using two or more components. Although the overall performance of 
      using ICD codes (0.67 ± 0.14) was only slightly lower than using two or more 
      components, its PPV (0.71 ± 0.13) is substantially worse (0.91 ± 0.08). 
      CONCLUSION: Multiple EHR components provide a more consistent and higher 
      performance than a single one for the selected phenotypes. We suggest considering 
      multiple EHR components for future phenotyping design in order to obtain an ideal 
      result.

TI  - Problem Oriented Medical Record: Characterizing the Use of the Problem List at 
      Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires.
PG  - 877
AB  - Problem oriented medical record (POMR) was born in late sixties. Expecting an 
      ordered, complete and updated medical record were some of the goals of its 
      founder. Several healthcare institutions have included problem list into their 
      clinical records but some concerns have been reported. These concerns are in 
      reference to their voluminosity, incompleteness and outdatedness. This study 
      attempts to understand how healthcare professionals are using the problem list at 
      Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA). We believe it is essential to 
      understand the local reality applied to our own applications and cultural 
      instances of documentation. This report is the basis from which several 
      improvements could be made in order to meet the goals of Weed's proposal.

TI  - Electronic Dental Records System Adoption.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - The use of Electronic Dental Records (EDRs) and management software has become 
      more frequent, following the increase in prevelance of new technologies and 
      computers in dental offices. The purpose of this study is to identify and 
      evaluate the use of EDRs by the dental community in the São Paulo city area. A 
      quantitative case study was performed using a survey on the phone. A total of 54 
      offices were contacted and only one declinedparticipation in this study. Only one 
      office did not have a computer. EDRs were used in 28 offices and only four were 
      paperless. The lack of studies in this area suggests the need for more usability 
      and implementation studies on EDRs so that we can improve EDR adoption by the 
      dental community.

TI  - An algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy in diabetes in computerised problem 
      orientated medical records (POMR) compared with an established algorithm 
      developed in episode orientated records (EOMR).
PG  - 255-64
LID - 10.14236/jhi.v22i2.79 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An algorithm that detects errors in diagnosis, classification or 
      coding of diabetes in primary care computerised medial record (CMR) systems is 
      currently available. However, this was developed on CMR systems that are episode 
      orientated medical records (EOMR); and do not force the user to always code a 
      problem or link data to an existing one. More strictly problem orientated medical 
      record (POMR) systems mandate recording a problem and linking consultation data 
      to them. OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of detection of diagnostic accuracy 
      using an algorithm developed in EOMR with a new POMR specific algorithm. METHOD: 
      We used data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (N = 2,466,364) 
      to identify a population of 100,513 (4.08%) patients considered likely to have 
      diabetes. We recalibrated algorithms designed to classify cases of diabetes to 
      take account of that POMR enforced coding consistency in the computerised medical 
      record systems [In Practice Systems (InPS) Vision] that contribute data to THIN. 
      We explored the different proportions of people classified as having type 1 
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with diabetes 
      unclassifiable as either T1DM or T2DM. We compared proportions using chi-square 
      tests and used Tukey's test to compare the characteristics of the people in each 
      group. RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM using the original EOMR algorithm was 
      0.38% (9,264/2,466,364), and for T2DM 3.22% (79,417/2,466,364). The prevalence 
      using the new POMR algorithm was 0.31% (7,750/2,466,364) T1DM and 3.65% 
      (89,990/2,466,364) T2DM. The EOMR algorithms also left more people unclassified 
      11,439 (12%), as to their type of diabetes compared with 2,380 (2.4%), for the 
      new algorithm. Those people who were only classified by the EOMR system differed 
      in terms of older age, and apparently better glycaemic control, despite not being 
      prescribed medication for their diabetes (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Increasing the 
      degree of problem orientation of the medical record system can improve the 
      accuracy of recording of diagnoses and, therefore, the accuracy of using 
      routinely collected data from CMRs to determine the prevalence of diabetes 
      mellitus; data processing strategies should reflect the degree of problem 
      orientation.

TI  - Problem list completeness in electronic health records: A multi-site study and 
      assessment of success factors.

LID - S1386-5056(15)30012-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2015.06.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess problem list completeness using an objective measure across 
      a range of sites, and to identify success factors for problem list completeness. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health record data 
      and interviews at ten healthcare organizations within the United States, United 
      Kingdom, and Argentina who use a variety of electronic health record systems: 
      four self-developed and six commercial. At each site, we assessed the proportion 
      of patients who have diabetes recorded on their problem list out of all patients 
      with a hemoglobin A1c elevation>=7.0%, which is diagnostic of diabetes. We then 
      conducted interviews with informatics leaders at the four highest performing 
      sites to determine factors associated with success. Finally, we surveyed all the 
      sites about common practices implemented at the top performing sites to determine 
      whether there was an association between problem list management practices and 
      problem list completeness. RESULTS: Problem list completeness across the ten 
      sites ranged from 60.2% to 99.4%, with a mean of 78.2%. Financial incentives, 
      problem-oriented charting, gap reporting, shared responsibility, links to billing 
      codes, and organizational culture were identified as success factors at the four 
      hospitals with problem list completeness at or near 90.0%. DISCUSSION: Incomplete 
      problem lists represent a global data integrity problem that could compromise 
      quality of care and put patients at risk. There was a wide range of problem list 
      completeness across the healthcare facilities. Nevertheless, some facilities have 
      achieved high levels of problem list completeness, and it is important to better 
      understand the factors that contribute to success to improve patient safety. 
      CONCLUSION: Problem list completeness varies substantially across healthcare 
      facilities. In our review of EHR systems at ten healthcare facilities, we 
      identified six success factors which may be useful for healthcare organizations 
      seeking to improve the quality of their problem list documentation: financial 
      incentives, problem oriented charting, gap reporting, shared responsibility, 
      links to billing codes, and organizational culture.

PG  - 334-44
LID - 10.4338/ACI-2015-01-RA-0010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical knowledge bases of problem-medication pairs are necessary 
      for many informatics solutions that improve patient safety, such as clinical 
      summarization. However, developing these knowledge bases can be challenging. 
      OBJECTIVE: We sought to validate a previously developed crowdsourcing approach 
      for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs in a large, 
      non-university health care system with a widely used, commercially available 
      electronic health record. METHODS: We first retrieved medications and problems 
      entered in the electronic health record by clinicians during routine care during 
      a six month study period. Following the previously published approach, we 
      calculated the link frequency and link ratio for each pair then identified a 
      threshold cutoff for estimated problem-medication pair appropriateness through 
      clinician review; problem-medication pairs meeting the threshold were included in 
      the resulting knowledge base. We selected 50 medications and their gold standard 
      indications to compare the resulting knowledge base to the pilot knowledge base 
      developed previously and determine its recall and precision. RESULTS: The 
      resulting knowledge base contained 26,912 pairs, had a recall of 62.3% and a 
      precision of 87.5%, and outperformed the pilot knowledge base containing 11,167 
      pairs from the previous study, which had a recall of 46.9% and a precision of 
      83.3%. CONCLUSIONS: We validated the crowdsourcing approach for generating a 
      knowledge base of problem-medication pairs in a large non-university health care 
      system with a widely used, commercially available electronic health record, 
      indicating that the approach may be generalizable across healthcare settings and 
      clinical systems. Further research is necessary to better evaluate the knowledge, 
      to compare crowdsourcing with other approaches, and to evaluate if incorporating 
      the knowledge into electronic health records improves patient outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were twofold: 1. To examine how an intervention 
      to apply fluoride varnish (FV) in a primary health setting to all young, 
      low-income children was implemented and sustained and 2. To assess the 
      feasibility of tracking medical care utilization in this population. STUDY 
      DESIGN: The study included children age 1-5, insured through a government 
      program, seen (7/1/2010-4/30/2012). Data on age, race, sex, clinic encounter, 
      eligibility for and receipt of FV was obtained. The level of data in primary 
      care, specialty care, urgent care and hospitalizations to assess feasibility of 
      future patient tracking was also acquired.. RESULTS: Of 12,067 children, 85% 
      received FV. Differences were found by age (youngest had highest rates). Small 
      differences by race (81%-88%, highest in Blacks.) was found. No differences were 
      found by sex. Ability to track over time was mixed. Approximately 50% had 
      comprehensive data. However, primary care visit and hospitalization data was 
      available on a larger percentage. CONCLUSIONS: FV programs can be introduced in 
      the primary care setting and sustained. Further, long-term follow up is possible. 
      Future study of such cohorts capturing health and cost benefits of oral health 
      prevention efforts is needed.

TI  - Care episode retrieval: distributional semantic models for information retrieval 
      in the clinical domain.
PG  - S2
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-15-S2-S2 [doi]
AB  - Patients' health related information is stored in electronic health records 
      (EHRs) by health service providers. These records include sequential 
      documentation of care episodes in the form of clinical notes. EHRs are used 
      throughout the health care sector by professionals, administrators and patients, 
      primarily for clinical purposes, but also for secondary purposes such as decision 
      support and research. The vast amounts of information in EHR systems complicate 
      information management and increase the risk of information overload. Therefore, 
      clinicians and researchers need new tools to manage the information stored in the 
      EHRs. A common use case is, given a--possibly unfinished--care episode, to 
      retrieve the most similar care episodes among the records. This paper presents 
      several methods for information retrieval, focusing on care episode retrieval, 
      based on textual similarity, where similarity is measured through domain-specific 
      modelling of the distributional semantics of words. Models include variants of 
      random indexing and the semantic neural network model word2vec. Two novel methods 
      are introduced that utilize the ICD-10 codes attached to care episodes to better 
      induce domain-specificity in the semantic model. We report on experimental 
      evaluation of care episode retrieval that circumvents the lack of human 
      judgements regarding episode relevance. Results suggest that several of the 
      methods proposed outperform a state-of-the art search engine (Lucene) on the 
      retrieval task.

TI  - Architecture Design of Healthcare Software-as-a-Service Platform for Cloud-Based 
      Clinical Decision Support Service.
PG  - 102-10
LID - 10.4258/hir.2015.21.2.102 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To design a cloud computing-based Healthcare Software-as-a-Service 
      (SaaS) Platform (HSP) for delivering healthcare information services with low 
      cost, high clinical value, and high usability. METHODS: We analyzed the 
      architecture requirements of an HSP, including the interface, business services, 
      cloud SaaS, quality attributes, privacy and security, and multi-lingual capacity. 
      For cloud-based SaaS services, we focused on Clinical Decision Service (CDS) 
      content services, basic functional services, and mobile services. Microsoft's 
      Azure cloud computing for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and 
      Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) was used. RESULTS: The functional and software views 
      of an HSP were designed in a layered architecture. External systems can be 
      interfaced with the HSP using SOAP and REST/JSON. The multi-tenancy model of the 
      HSP was designed as a shared database, with a separate schema for each tenant 
      through a single application, although healthcare data can be physically located 
      on a cloud or in a hospital, depending on regulations. The CDS services were 
      categorized into rule-based services for medications, alert registration 
      services, and knowledge services. CONCLUSIONS: We expect that cloud-based HSPs 
      will allow small and mid-sized hospitals, in addition to large-sized hospitals, 
      to adopt information infrastructures and health information technology with low 
      system operation and maintenance costs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Analysis of encounter data relevant to the diagnostic process sourced 
      from routine electronic medical record (EMR) databases represents a classic 
      example of the concept of a learning healthcare system (LHS). By collecting 
      International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) coded EMR data as part of the 
      Transition Project from Dutch and Maltese databases (using the EMR TransHIS), 
      data mining algorithms can empirically quantify the relationships of all 
      presenting reasons for encounter (RfEs) and recorded diagnostic outcomes. We have 
      specifically looked at new episodes of care (EoC) for two urinary system 
      infections: simple urinary tract infection (UTI, ICPC code: U71) and 
      pyelonephritis (ICPC code: U70). METHODS: Participating family doctors (FDs) 
      recorded details of all their patient contacts in an EoC structure using the 
      ICPC, including RfEs presented by the patient, and the FDs' diagnostic labels. 
      The relationships between RfEs and episode titles were studied using 
      probabilistic and data mining methods as part of the TRANSFoRm project. RESULTS: 
      The Dutch data indicated that the presence of RfE's "Cystitis/Urinary Tract 
      Infection", "Dysuria", "Fear of UTI", "Urinary frequency/urgency", "Haematuria", 
      "Urine symptom/complaint, other" are all strong, reliable, predictors for the 
      diagnosis "Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection" . The Maltese data indicated that 
      the presence of RfE's "Dysuria", "Urinary frequency/urgency", "Haematuria" are 
      all strong, reliable, predictors for the diagnosis "Cystitis/Urinary Tract 
      Infection". The Dutch data indicated that the presence of RfE's "Flank/axilla 
      symptom/complaint", "Dysuria", "Fever", "Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infection", 
      "Abdominal pain/cramps general" are all strong, reliable, predictors for the 
      diagnosis "Pyelonephritis" . The Maltese data set did not present any clinically 
      and statistically significant predictors for pyelonephritis. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      describe clinically and statistically significant diagnostic associations 
      observed between UTIs and pyelonephritis presenting as a new problem in family 
      practice, and all associated RfEs, and demonstrate that the significant 
      diagnostic cues obtained are consistent with the literature. We conclude that it 
      is possible to generate clinically meaningful diagnostic evidence from electronic 
      sources of patient data.

      low back pain: original results from the Dutch Transition Project.
PG  - 297-304
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmv027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Better insight into frequent comorbidities in patients with chronic 
      (≥ 3 months) low back pain (LBP) may help general practitioners when planning 
      comprehensive care for these patients. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively study the 
      prevalence of psychological, social, musculoskeletal and somatoform disorders in 
      patients presenting with chronic non-specific LBP to general practitioners, in 
      comparison to a contrast group of patients consulting in the same setting. 
      METHODS: This case-control study is embedded in a historical cohort, based on a 
      primary care practice-based research network. All the health problems presented 
      by the patients were prospectively coded according to the international 
      classification of primary care between 1996 and 2013. The prevalence of 
      psychological, social, musculoskeletal and somatoform disorders presented by the 
      adult patients from 1 year before the onset of chronic LBP to 2 years after onset 
      was compared to that of matched patients consulting without LBP, using 
      conditional logistic regressions. RESULTS: The 1511 patients with chronic LBP 
      more often presented musculoskeletal disorders than the contrast group during the 
      year before the onset of LBP and during the second year after it, with odds 
      ratios (95%confidence intervals) of 1.39 (1.20-1.61) and 1.56 (1.35-1.81), 
      respectively. They did not more often present psychological, social or 
      non-musculoskeletal somatoform disorders. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners 
      should consider all the musculoskeletal symptoms when caring for patients with 
      chronic LBP. Rather than systematically screening for specific psychological, 
      social or somatoform disorders, they should consider with the patient how LBP and 
      any type of potential comorbidity interfere with his/her daily functioning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Develop and test web services to retrieve and identify the most 
      precise ICD-10-CM code(s) for a given clinical encounter. Facilitate creation of 
      user interfaces that 1) provide an initial shortlist of candidate codes, ideally 
      visible on a single screen; and 2) enable code refinement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      To satisfy our high-level use cases, the analysis and design process involved 
      reviewing available maps and crosswalks, designing the rule adjudication 
      framework, determining necessary metadata, retrieving related codes, and 
      iteratively improving the code refinement algorithm. RESULTS: The Partners 
      ICD-10-CM Search and Mapping Services (PI-10 Services) are SOAP web services 
      written using Microsoft's.NET 4.0 Framework, Windows Communications Framework, 
      and SQL Server 2012. The services cover 96% of the Partners problem list subset 
      of SNOMED CT codes that map to ICD-10-CM codes and can return up to 76% of the 
      69,823 billable ICD-10-CM codes prior to creation of custom mapping rules. 
      DISCUSSION: We consider ways to increase 1) the coverage ratio of the Partners 
      problem list subset of SNOMED CT codes and 2) the upper bound of returnable 
      ICD-10-CM codes by creating custom mapping rules. Future work will investigate 
      the utility of the transitive closure of SNOMED CT codes and other methods to 
      assist in custom rule creation and, ultimately, to provide more complete coverage 
      of ICD-10-CM codes. CONCLUSIONS: ICD-10-CM will be easier for clinicians to 
      manage if applications display short lists of candidate codes from which 
      clinicians can subsequently select a code for further refinement. The PI-10 
      Services support ICD-10 migration by implementing this paradigm and enabling 
      users to consistently and accurately find the best ICD-10-CM code(s) without 
      translation from ICD-9-CM.

TI  - An exploration of the properties of the CORE problem list subset and how it 
      facilitates the implementation of SNOMED CT.
PG  - 649-58
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocu022 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is 
      the emergent international health terminology standard for encoding clinical 
      information in electronic health records. The CORE Problem List Subset was 
      created to facilitate the terminology's implementation. This study evaluates the 
      CORE Subset's coverage and examines its growth pattern as source datasets are 
      being incorporated. METHODS: Coverage of frequently used terms and the 
      corresponding usage of the covered terms were assessed by "leave-one-out" 
      analysis of the eight datasets constituting the current CORE Subset. The growth 
      pattern was studied using a retrospective experiment, growing the Subset one 
      dataset at a time and examining the relationship between the size of the starting 
      subset and the coverage of frequently used terms in the incoming dataset. Linear 
      regression was used to model that relationship. RESULTS: On average, the CORE 
      Subset covered 80.3% of the frequently used terms of the left-out dataset, and 
      the covered terms accounted for 83.7% of term usage. There was a significant 
      positive correlation between the CORE Subset's size and the coverage of the 
      frequently used terms in an incoming dataset. This implies that the CORE Subset 
      will grow at a progressively slower pace as it gets bigger. CONCLUSION: The CORE 
      Problem List Subset is a useful resource for the implementation of Systematized 
      Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms in electronic health records. It offers 
      good coverage of frequently used terms, which account for a high proportion of 
      term usage. If future datasets are incorporated into the CORE Subset, it is 
      likely that its size will remain small and manageable.

TI  - A comparison between interactions of triglyceride oil and mineral oil with 
      proteins and their ability to reduce cleanser surfactant-induced irritation.
PG  - 371-8
LID - 10.1111/ics.12205 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Skin irritation in personal cleansing has been correlated with 
      surfactant binding with stratum corneum proteins. Polar and non-polar oils are 
      increasingly being used in cleansing formulations which contain high (10-15%) 
      level of anionic and non-ionic surfactants. However, the effects of oils in 
      modulating skin damage from a cleansing product have not been studied in any 
      detail. The objectives of this study are to determine whether low-viscosity polar 
      and non-polar oils differ in their ability to reduce surfactant-induced skin 
      irritation and, if so, how it might be related to their interactions with 
      proteins. METHODS: Surfactant-induced skin irritation was measured by a 14-day in 
      vivo cumulative patch irritation test. The methodology was similar to the 
      well-known soap chamber test. Surfactant interactions with the water-soluble 
      protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), in the presence of oils were measured by 
      conductometric titration. The effects of low-viscosity polar and non-polar oils 
      on stratum corneum protein dynamics in the sulfhydryl group region were studied 
      by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) using the covalently bound spin-label 
      3-maleimido-proxyl (5-MSL). EPR measurements were performed with stratum corneums 
      obtained from discarded skins of 3- to 4-week-old female pigs. Simulation of the 
      complex spectra provided insights on the environment and mobility of the 
      protein-bound spin label. RESULTS: Addition of 1% polar sunflower seed oil 
      (viscosity 42 centipoise) reduced in vivo irritation of 1% sodium lauryl ether 
      sulphate with two ethoxylate/cocamidopropyl betaine (SLES/CAPB) by 20%, whereas 
      1% non-polar mineral oil (viscosity 15 centipoise) had no effect. Polar oil 
      glyceryl trioleate (a major component in sunflower seed oil) at 10% level reduced 
      surfactant binding to BSA protein in water by 40%, whereas the non-polar oil 
      dodecane (a major component of mineral oil) at a similar level did not have any 
      effect. The mobility of the spin label in a dry corneum was very low and was 
      increased significantly with the addition of water and glycerol trioleate but 
      less so with mineral oil. CONCLUSION: Sunflower seed oil reduces 
      surfactant-induced in vivo skin irritation more than mineral oil. This is 
      possibly due to stronger interaction of polar oil with proteins, thus protecting 
      it from surfactant binding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the opinions, emotions, and actions taken by patients 
      who viewed their electronic problem list via an online personal health record 
      (PHR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey of patients who viewed their 
      problem lists, as maintained by their healthcare provider, in a web-based PHR 
      linked to an electronic health record for the first time. RESULTS: A total 3,649 
      patients completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 42.1%. Patient 
      attitudes towards the problem list function were positive overall, with 90.4% 
      rating it at least somewhat useful and 86.7% reporting they would probably or 
      definitely use it again. Nearly half (45.6%) of patients identified at least one 
      major or minor problem missing from their list. After viewing the list, 56.1% of 
      patients reported taking at least one action in response, with 32.4% of patients 
      reporting that they researched a condition on the Internet, 18.3% reported that 
      they contacted their healthcare provider and 16.7% reported changing or planning 
      to change a health behavior (patients could report multiple actions). 64.7% of 
      patients reported feeling at least somewhat happy while viewing their problem 
      list, though others reported feeling sad (30.4%), worried (35.7%) or scared 
      (23.8%) (patients could report multiple emotions). A smaller number of patients 
      reported feeling angry (16.6%) or ashamed (14.3%). Patients who experienced an 
      emotional response were more likely to take action. CONCLUSION: Overall, patients 
      found the ability to view their problem lists very useful and took action in 
      response to the information. However, some had negative emotions. More research 
      is needed into optimal strategies for supporting patients receiving this 
      information.

TI  - Extension of the primary care research object model (PCROM) as clinical research 
      information model (CRIM) for the "learning healthcare system".

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient data from general practices is already used for many types of 
      epidemiological research and increasingly, primary care systems to facilitate 
      randomized clinical trials. The EU funded project TRANSFoRm aims to create a 
      "Learning Healthcare System" at a European level that is able to support all 
      types of research using primary care data, to recruit patients and follow 
      patients in clinical studies and to improve diagnosis and therapy. The 
      implementation of such a Learning Healthcare System needs an information model 
      for clinical research (CRIM), as an informational backbone to integrate aspects 
      of primary care with clinical trials and database searches. METHODS: Workflow 
      descriptions and corresponding data objects of two clinical use cases 
      (Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease and Type 2 Diabetes) were described in UML 
      activity diagrams. The components of activity diagrams were mapped to information 
      objects of PCROM (Primary Care Research Object Model) and BRIDG (Biomedical 
      Research Integrated Domain Group) and evaluated. The class diagram of PCROM was 
      adapted to comply with workflow descriptions. RESULTS: The suitability of PCROM, 
      a primary care information model already used for clinical trials, to act as an 
      information model for TRANSFoRm was evaluated and resulted in its extension with 
      14 new information object types, two extensions of existing objects and the 
      introduction of two new high-ranking concepts (CARE area and ENTRY area). No 
      PCROM component was redundant. Our result illustrates that in primary care based 
      research an important but underestimated portion of research activity takes place 
      in the area of care (e.g. patient consultation, screening, recruitment and 
      response to adverse events). The newly introduced CARE area for care-related 
      research activities accounts for this shift and includes Episode of Care and 
      Encounter as two new basic elements. In the ENTRY area different aspects of data 
      collection were combined, including data semantics for observations, assessment 
      activities, intervention activities and patient reporting to enable case report 
      form (CRF) based data collection combined with decision support. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Research with primary care data needs an extended information model that covers 
      research activities at the care site which are characteristic for primary care 
      based research and the requirements of the complicated data collection processes.

AB  - For more than 25 years, emergency medicine researchers have examined 72-hour 
      return visits as a marker for high-risk patient visits and as a surrogate measure 
      for quality of care. Individual emergency departments frequently use 72-hour 
      returns as a screening tool to identify deficits in care, although comprehensive 
      departmental reviews of this nature may consume considerable resources. We 
      discuss the lack of published data supporting the use of 72-hour return frequency 
      as an overall performance measure and examine why this is not a valid use, 
      describe a conceptual framework for reviewing 72-hour return cases as a screening 
      tool, and call for future studies to test various models for conducting such 
      quality assurance reviews of patients who return to the emergency department 
      within 72 hours.

AB  - The dramatic increase in broadband connectivity is opening up the possibility for 
      using telehealth-connected teams in an improved system for charity care. The 
      Virtual Dental Home demonstration taking place in California provides a model for 
      the development and deployment of such teams. Teams using telehealth connections 
      to provide oral health care can transform episodic or one-time visits into an 
      ongoing system of care with a much greater emphasis on prevention and early 
      intervention techniques and a greater likelihood of improved oral health for the 
      population.

TI  - A quality improvement study to improve inpatient problem list use.
PG  - 205-10
LID - 10.1542/hpeds.2013-0060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The problem list is a meaningful use incentivized criterion, and >80% 
      of patients should have 1 problem entered as structured data. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of the present study was to use a series of interventions to increase the use of 
      the problem list for inpatients to >80% as measured by at least 1 hospital 
      problem at discharge. METHODS: This study was a quasi-experimental time series 
      quality improvement trial. The primary outcome was 80% of medical and psychiatric 
      inpatients with a problem added to the problem list before discharge. Control 
      charts of percentage (p charts) of medical and psychiatric patients with an 
      inpatient problem list at discharge were constructed with three-σ control limits. 
      Control limits were revised after evidence of improvement. The charts were 
      annotated with interventions, including increasing awareness, focused education, 
      and timely feedback in the form of performance graphs e-mailed to providers. 
      RESULTS: For medical inpatients, use rose from 31% to 97% at its peak in April 
      2011 and continues to maintain above the goal of 80%. In psychiatry, problem list 
      use rose from 2% initially to an average of 72% after the interventions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Significant gains were made with inpatient problem list usage by the 
      medical and psychiatric teams. Our goal ascribed by meaningful use for >80% of 
      inpatients to have a problem at discharge was met after initiation of our series 
      of interventions.

TI  - Numbers and proportions of U.S. military members in treatment for mental 
      disorders over time, active component, January 2000-September 2013.
PG  - 2-7
AB  - This report examines trends in health record documentation of the treatment for 
      mental disorders of active component U.S. military service members from January 
      2000 through September 2013. Inpatient and outpatient records were used to 
      estimate the numbers and proportions of service members who received such 
      treatment and the durations and intensities of courses of treatment. Annual 
      numbers of service members who received treatment for mental disorders and the 
      annual numbers of treatment courses increased steadily from 2004-2012. More than 
      half of service members who received such treatment had only one treatment 
      course, but the annual numbers of such single treatment courses increased by 60% 
      during the 13-year surveillance period. Annual numbers of treatment courses that 
      consisted of more than 30 encounters increased 5.6-fold between 2001 and 2012 and 
      the mean number of days per treatment course markedly increased during the last 
      half of the period. The proportion of overall service time contributed by members 
      who were in treatment for mental disorders increased from about 1% in 2000 to 
      3.5% in 2012. The methods and findings of this analysis are compared and 
      contrasted with other published studies and reports about mental health problems 
      in the Armed Forces since the beginning of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

TI  - Bringing science to medicine: an interview with Larry Weed, inventor of the 
      problem-oriented medical record.
PG  - 964-8
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002776 [doi]
AB  - Larry Weed, MD is widely known as the father of the problem-oriented medical 
      record and inventor of the now-ubiquitous SOAP 
      (subjective/objective/assessment/plan) note, for developing an electronic health 
      record system (Problem-Oriented Medical Information System, PROMIS), and for 
      founding a company (since acquired), which developed problem-knowledge couplers. 
      However, Dr Weed's vision for medicine goes far beyond software--over the course 
      of his storied career, he has relentlessly sought to bring the scientific method 
      to medical practice and, where necessary, to point out shortcomings in the system 
      and advocate for change. In this oral history, Dr Weed describes, in his own 
      words, the arcs of his long career and the work that remains to be done.

TI  - Identifying inconsistencies in SNOMED CT problem lists using structural 
      indicators.
PG  - 17-26
AB  - The National Library of Medicine has published the CORE and the VA/KP problem 
      lists to facilitate the usage of SNOMED CT for encoding diagnoses and clinical 
      data of patients in electronic health records. Therefore, it is essential for the 
      content of the problem lists to be as accurate and consistent as possible. This 
      study assesses the effectiveness of using a concept's word length and number of 
      parents, two structural indicators for measuring concept complexity, to identify 
      inconsistencies with high probability. The method is able to isolate concepts 
      with over 40% expected of being erroneous. A structural indicator for concepts 
      which is able to identify 52% of the examined concepts as having errors in 
      synonyms is also presented. The results demonstrate that the concepts in problem 
      lists are not free of inconsistencies and further quality assurance is needed to 
      improve the quality of these concepts.

AB  - Patients' medical conditions often evolve in complex and seemingly unpredictable 
      ways. Even within a relatively narrow and well-defined episode of care, 
      variations between patients in both their progression and eventual outcome can be 
      dramatic. Understanding the patterns of events observed within a population that 
      most correlate with differences in outcome is therefore an important task in many 
      types of studies using retrospective electronic health data. In this paper, we 
      present a method for interactive pattern mining and analysis that supports ad hoc 
      visual exploration of patterns mined from retrospective clinical patient data. 
      Our approach combines (1) visual query capabilities to interactively specify 
      episode definitions, (2) pattern mining techniques to help discover important 
      intermediate events within an episode, and (3) interactive visualization 
      techniques that help uncover event patterns that most impact outcome and how 
      those associations change over time. In addition to presenting our methodology, 
      we describe a prototype implementation and present use cases highlighting the 
      types of insights or hypotheses that our approach can help uncover.

TI  - Enabling claims-based decision support through non-interruptive capture of 
      admission diagnoses and provider billing codes.
PG  - 1950-9
AB  - The patient problem list, like administrative claims data, has become an 
      important source of data for decision support, patient cohort identification, and 
      alerting systems. A two-fold intervention to increase capture of problems on the 
      problem list automatically - with minimal disruption to admitting and provider 
      billing workflows - is described. For new patients with no prior data in the 
      electronic health record, the intervention resulted in a statistically 
      significant increase in the number of problems recorded to the problem list (3.8 
      vs 2.9 problems post-and pre-intervention respectively, p value 2×10(-16)). The 
      majority of problems were recorded in the first 24 hours of admission. The 
      proportion of patients with at least one problem coded to the problem list within 
      the first 24 hours increased from 94% to 98% before and after intervention (chi 
      square 344, p value 2×10(-16)). ICD9 "V codes" connoting circumstances beyond 
      disease were captured at a higher rate post intervention than before. 
      Deyo/Charlson comorbidities derived from problem list data were more similar to 
      those derived from claims data after the intervention than before (Jaccard 
      similarity 0.3 post- vs 0.21 pre-intervention, p value 2×10(-16)). A 
      workflow-sensitive, non-interruptive means of capturing provider-entered codes 
      early in admission can improve both the quantity and content of problems on the 
      patient problem list.

TI  - Development of a clinician reputation metric to identify appropriate 
      problem-medication pairs in a crowdsourced knowledge base.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Correlation of data within electronic health records is necessary for 
      implementation of various clinical decision support functions, including patient 
      summarization. A key type of correlation is linking medications to clinical 
      problems; while some databases of problem-medication links are available, they 
      are not robust and depend on problems and medications being encoded in particular 
      terminologies. Crowdsourcing represents one approach to generating robust 
      knowledge bases across a variety of terminologies, but more sophisticated 
      approaches are necessary to improve accuracy and reduce manual data review 
      requirements. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop and evaluate a clinician reputation 
      metric to facilitate the identification of appropriate problem-medication pairs 
      through crowdsourcing without requiring extensive manual review. APPROACH: We 
      retrieved medications from our clinical data warehouse that had been prescribed 
      and manually linked to one or more problems by clinicians during e-prescribing 
      between June 1, 2010 and May 31, 2011. We identified measures likely to be 
      associated with the percentage of accurate problem-medication links made by 
      clinicians. Using logistic regression, we created a metric for identifying 
      clinicians who had made greater than or equal to 95% appropriate links. We 
      evaluated the accuracy of the approach by comparing links made by those 
      physicians identified as having appropriate links to a previously manually 
      validated subset of problem-medication pairs. RESULTS: Of 867 clinicians who 
      asserted a total of 237,748 problem-medication links during the study period, 125 
      had a reputation metric that predicted the percentage of appropriate links 
      greater than or equal to 95%. These clinicians asserted a total of 2464 linked 
      problem-medication pairs (983 distinct pairs). Compared to a previously validated 
      set of problem-medication pairs, the reputation metric achieved a specificity of 
      99.5% and marginally improved the sensitivity of previously described knowledge 
      bases. CONCLUSION: A reputation metric may be a valuable measure for identifying 
      high quality clinician-entered, crowdsourced data.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Whereas an unprecedented effort is currently under way worldwide for 
      the implementation of electronic health record (EHR) systems, their capabilities 
      are poorly understood, especially in primary care. The objective of this study 
      was to assess the main functionalities of the EHR systems used in French general 
      practices. METHODS: Among the 20 EHR systems marketed in France, we assessed the 
      15 systems used by more than 1500 general practitioners in the 
      Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region in the southeast part of France. Each EHR 
      system was assessed in a general practice office, using two clinical vignettes 
      describing virtual patient consultations. The evaluation criteria were derived 
      from the EuroRec requirements for EHR system quality. The assessment scale 
      included 37 criteria grouped into three sets: background data, consultation data, 
      and exchange functionalities. The scoring system used, totalling 64 points, was 
      based on the validation of the criteria and was adjusted based on the possibility 
      of standardising the data. A high score indicated a good EHR system quality. 
      RESULTS: The median global score was 32 points out of a possible 64 (range: 
      20-39). The median score was 12 points out of 22 (range: 6-15) for the background 
      data set, 16 points out of 32 (range: 9-22) for the consultation data set, and 
      four points out of 10 (range: 0-6) for the exchange functionalities. No 
      association was found between the number of users and the assessment score of the 
      EHR systems (p=0.79). One third of the EHR systems lacked a problem list and only 
      one of them supported the episode of care. CONCLUSION: Functionalities noticeably 
      vary among the EHR systems currently used in French primary care. Whereas these 
      systems are globally very focused on drug prescriptions, several core 
      functionalities are frequently lacking. They are also poorly interoperable for 
      healthcare professionals and patients. Further research is necessary to assess 
      their actual use.

TI  - Adding obesity to the problem list increases the rate of providers addressing 
      obesity.
PG  - 629-33
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a common problem that increases risk of 
      many other diseases, from heart disease to cancer. While counseling by a 
      physician increases patient report of weight loss attempts and increased 
      exercise, primary care physicians do not frequently address obesity. The 
      objectives of this study were to determine how often obesity was included on the 
      problem list and whether adding obesity to the problem list affected the rate at 
      which it was addressed in future visits. METHODS: We conducted an initial 
      assessment, followed by a randomized controlled trial of patient records at a 
      family medicine residency office. The intervention was the addition of obesity to 
      the problem list. The measured outcome was whether or not obesity was listed as 
      an encounter diagnosis in the following 5 months. RESULTS: At baseline, 36.2% of 
      obese patients had obesity on their problem list. A total of 55.5% of these 
      patients had obesity addressed by a provider in the past year, compared with 5.1% 
      of patients who did not have obesity on their problem list. In the 5 months 
      following the intervention, 38 (14.7%) of the 258 patients in the intervention 
      group had obesity addressed, compared with 11 (4.6%) of the 239 patients in the 
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant relationship between the 
      addition of obesity to the problem list and providers addressing obesity at 
      future visits. This simple intervention could be accomplished automatically by 
      the EMR and has the potential to change provider behavior.

AB  - This study aims to provide security solutions for implementing electronic medical 
      records (EMRs). E-Health organizations could utilize the proposed method and 
      implement recommended solutions in medical/health systems. Majority of the 
      required security features of EMRs were noted. The methods used were tested 
      against each of these security features. In implementing the system, the 
      combination that satisfied all of the security features of EMRs was selected. 
      Secure implementation and management of EMRs facilitate the safeguarding of the 
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability of e-health organization systems. 
      Health practitioners, patients, and visitors can use the information system 
      facilities safely and with confidence anytime and anywhere. After critically 
      reviewing security and data transmission methods, a new hybrid method was 
      proposed to be implemented on EMR systems. This method will enhance the 
      robustness, security, and integration of EMR systems. The hybrid of simple object 
      access protocol/extensible markup language (XML) with advanced encryption 
      standard and secure hash algorithm version 1 has achieved the security 
      requirements of an EMR system with the capability of integrating with other 
      systems through the design of XML messages.

TI  - An observation tool for studying patient-oriented workflow in hospital emergency

LID - 10.3414/ME12-01-0079 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studying workflow is a critical step in designing, implementing and 
      evaluating informatics interventions in complex sociotechnical settings, such as 
      hospital emergency departments (EDs). Known approaches to studying workflow in 
      clinical settings attend to the activities of individual clinicians, thus being 
      inadequate to characterize patient care as a cooperative work. OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a novel, theory-driven 
      patient-oriented workflow methodology, which better addresses the complex, 
      multiple-provider nature of patient care. Second, we report the development of an 
      observational tool and protocol for use in studies of this type, and the results 
      of an evaluation study. METHODS: We created a tablet computer implementation of 
      an instrument to efficiently capture patient-oriented workflow, and evaluated it 
      through a field study in three EDs. We focused on activities occurring over time 
      during a single patient care episode as well as the roles of the ED staff members 
      who conducted the activities. RESULTS: The evidence generated supports the 
      validity, viability, and reliability of the tool. The coverage of the tool in 
      terms of activities and roles was satisfactory. The tool was able to capture the 
      sequence of activity-role pairs for 108 patient care episodes. The inter-rater 
      reliability assessment yielded a high kappa value (0.79). DISCUSSION: The 
      patient-oriented workflow methodology has the potential to facilitate modeling 
      patient care in EDs by characterizing both roles and activities in sequence. The 
      methodology also provides researchers and practitioners a more realistic and 
      comprehensive workflow perspective that can inform the design, implementation and 
      evaluation of health information technology interventions.

PG  - 1163
AB  - Physicians do not always keep the problem list accurate, complete and updated. 
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze natural language processing (NLP) techniques and inference 
      rules as strategies to maintain completeness and accuracy of the problem list in 
      EHRs. METHODS: Non systematic literature review in PubMed, in the last 10 years. 
      Strategies to maintain the EHRs problem list were analyzed in two ways: inputting 
      and removing problems from the problem list. RESULTS: NLP and inference rules 
      have acceptable performance for inputting problems into the problem list. No 
      studies using these techniques for removing problems were published Conclusion: 
      Both tools, NLP and inference rules have had acceptable results as tools for 
      maintain the completeness and accuracy of the problem list.

PG  - 1036
AB  - In Japan, POS (problem oriented system) is recommended in the clinical guideline. 
      Therefore, the records are mainly made by SOAP. We developed a system mainly with 
      a function which enabled our staff members of all kinds of professions including 
      doctors to enter the patients' clinical information as an identical record, 
      regardless if they were outpatients or inpatients, and to observe the contents 
      chronologically. This electric patient record system is called "e-kanja recording 
      system". On this system, all staff members in the medical team can now share the 
      same information. Moreover, the contents can be reviewed by colleagues; the 
      quality of records has been improved as it is evaluated by the others.

AB  - In 2013, electronic documentation of clinical care stands at a crossroads. The 
      benefits of creating digital notes are at risk of being overwhelmed by the 
      inclusion of easily importable detail. Providers are the primary authors of 
      encounters with patients. We must document clearly our understanding of patients 
      and our communication with them and our colleagues. We want to document 
      efficiently to meet without exceeding documentation guidelines. We copy and paste 
      documentation, because it not only simplifies the documentation process 
      generally, but also supports meeting coding and regulatory requirements 
      specifically. Since the primary goal of our profession is to spend as much time 
      as possible listening to, understanding and helping patients, clinicians need 
      information technology to make electronic documentation easier, not harder. At 
      the same time, there should be reasonable restrictions on the use of copy and 
      paste to limit the growing challenge of 'note bloat'. We must find the right 
      balance between ease of use and thoughtless documentation. The guiding principles 
      in this document may be used to launch an interdisciplinary dialogue that 
      promotes useful and necessary documentation that best facilitates efficient 
      information capture and effective display.

TI  - Health care transformation through collaboration on open-source informatics 
      projects: integrating a medical applications platform, research data repository, 
      and patient summarization.
PG  - e11
LID - 10.2196/ijmr.2454 [doi]
LID - e11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) program 
      seeks to conquer well-understood challenges in medical informatics through 
      breakthrough research. Two SHARP centers have found alignment in their 
      methodological needs: (1) members of the National Center for Cognitive 
      Informatics and Decision-making (NCCD) have developed knowledge bases to support 
      problem-oriented summarizations of patient data, and (2) Substitutable Medical 
      Apps, Reusable Technologies (SMART), which is a platform for reusable medical 
      apps that can run on participating platforms connected to various electronic 
      health records (EHR). Combining the work of these two centers will ensure wide 
      dissemination of new methods for synthesized views of patient data. Informatics 
      for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is an NIH-funded clinical research 
      data repository platform in use at over 100 sites worldwide. By also working with 
      a co-occurring initiative to SMART-enabling i2b2, we can confidently write one 
      app that can be used extremely broadly. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to facilitate 
      development of intuitive, problem-oriented views of the patient record using NCCD 
      knowledge bases that would run in any EHR. To do this, we developed a 
      collaboration between the two SHARPs and an NIH center, i2b2. METHODS: First, we 
      implemented collaborative tools to connect researchers at three institutions. 
      Next, we developed a patient summarization app using the SMART platform and a 
      previously validated NCCD problem-medication linkage knowledge base derived from 
      the National Drug File-Reference Terminology (NDF-RT). Finally, to SMART-enable 
      i2b2, we implemented two new Web service "cells" that expose the SMART 
      application programming interface (API), and we made changes to the Web interface 
      of i2b2 to host a "carousel" of SMART apps. RESULTS: We deployed our SMART-based, 
      NDF-RT-derived patient summarization app in this SMART-i2b2 container. It 
      displays a problem-oriented view of medications and presents a line-graph display 
      of laboratory results. CONCLUSIONS: This summarization app can be run in any EHR 
      environment that either supports SMART or runs SMART-enabled i2b2. This i2b2 
      "clinical bridge" demonstrates a pathway for reusable app development that does 
      not require EHR vendors to immediately adopt the SMART API. Apps can be developed 
      in SMART and run by clinicians in the i2b2 repository, reusing clinical data 
      extracted from EHRs. This may encourage the adoption of SMART by supporting SMART 
      app development until EHRs adopt the platform. It also allows a new variety of 
      clinical SMART apps, fueled by the broad aggregation of data types available in 
      research repositories. The app (including its knowledge base) and SMART-i2b2 are 
      open-source and freely available for download.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: By 2015, SNOMED CT (SCT) will become the USA's standard for encoding 
      diagnoses and problem lists in electronic health records (EHRs). To facilitate 
      this effort, the National Library of Medicine has published the "SCT Clinical 
      Observations Recording and Encoding" and the "Veterans Health Administration and 
      Kaiser Permanente" problem lists (collectively, the "PL"). The PL is studied in 
      regard to its readiness to support meaningful use of EHRs. In particular, we wish 
      to determine if inconsistencies appearing in SCT, in general, occur as frequently 
      in the PL, and whether further quality-assurance (QA) efforts on the PL are 
      required. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A study is conducted where two random samples of 
      SCT concepts are compared. The first consists of concepts strictly from the PL 
      and the second contains general SCT concepts distributed proportionally to the 
      PL's in terms of their hierarchies. Each sample is analyzed for its percentage of 
      primitive concepts and for frequency of modeling errors of various severity 
      levels as quality measures. A simple structural indicator, namely, the number of 
      parents, is suggested to locate high likelihood inconsistencies in hierarchical 
      relationships. The effectiveness of this indicator is evaluated. RESULTS: PL 
      concepts are found to be slightly better than other concepts in the respective 
      SCT hierarchies with regards to the quality measure of the percentage of 
      primitive concepts and the frequency of modeling errors. There were 58% primitive 
      concepts in the PL sample versus 62% in the control sample. The structural 
      indicator of number of parents is shown to be statistically significant in its 
      ability to identify concepts having a higher likelihood of inconsistencies in 
      their hierarchical relationships. The absolute number of errors in the group of 
      concepts having 1-3 parents was shown to be significantly lower than that for 
      concepts with 4-6 parents and those with 7 or more parents based on Chi-squared 
      analyses. CONCLUSION: PL concepts suffer from the same issues as general SCT 
      concepts, although to a slightly lesser extent, and do require further QA efforts 
      to promote meaningful use of EHRs. To support such efforts, a structural 
      indicator is shown to effectively ferret out potentially problematic concepts 
      where those QA efforts should be focused.

TI  - The interpretation of the reasons for encounter 'cough' and 'sadness' in four 
      international family medicine populations.
PG  - 25-39
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is a study of the relationships between common reasons for 
      encounter (RfEs) and common diagnoses (episode titles) within episodes of care 
      (EoCs) in family practice populations in four countries. METHOD: Participating 
      family doctors (FDs) recorded details of all their patient contacts in an EoC 
      structure using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), 
      including RfEs presented by the patient, and the FDs' diagnostic labels. The 
      relationships between RfEs and episode titles were studied using Bayesian 
      methods. RESULTS: The RfE 'cough' is a strong, reliable predictor for the 
      diagnoses 'cough' (a symptom diagnosis), 'acute bronchitis', 'URTI' and 'acute 
      laryngitis/tracheitis' and a less strong, but reliable predictor for 'sinusitis', 
      'pneumonia', 'influenza', 'asthma', 'other viral diseases (NOS)', 'whooping 
      cough', 'chronic bronchitis', 'wheezing' and 'phlegm'. The absence of cough is a 
      weak but reliable predictor to exclude a diagnosis of 'cough', 'acute bronchitis' 
      and 'tracheitis'. Its presence allows strong and reliable exclusion of the 
      diagnoses 'gastroenteritis', 'no disease' and 'health promotion/prevention', and 
      less strong exclusion of 'adverse effects of medication'. The RfE 'sadness' is a 
      strong, reliable predictor for the diagnoses 'feeling sad/depressed' and 
      'depressive disorder'. It is a less strong, but reliable predictor of a diagnosis 
      of 'acute stress reaction'. The absence of sadness (as a symptom) is a weak but 
      reliable predictor to exclude the symptom diagnosis 'feeling sad/depressed'. Its 
      presence does not support the exclusion of any diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      describe clinically and statistically significant diagnostic associations 
      observed between the RfEs 'cough' and 'sadness', presenting as a new problem in 
      family practice, and all the episode titles in ICPC.

TI  - Revisiting the concept of 'chronic disease' from the perspective of the episode 
      of care model. Does the ratio of incidence to prevalence rate help us to define a 
      problem as chronic?
PG  - 13-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is a study of the epidemiology of acute and chronic episodes of 
      care (EoCs) in the Transition Project in three countries. We studied the duration 
      of EoCs for acute and chronic health problems and the relationship of incidence 
      to prevalence rates for these EoCs. METHOD: The Transition Project databases 
      collect data on all elements of the doctor-patient encounter in family medicine. 
      Family doctors code these elements using the International Classification of 
      Primary Care. We used the data from three practice populations to study the 
      duration of EoCs and the ratio of incidence to prevalence for common health 
      problems. RESULTS: We found that chronic health problems tended to have 
      proportionately longer duration EoCs, as expected, but also a lower incidence to 
      prevalence rate ratio than acute health problems. Thus, the incidence to 
      prevalence index could be used to define a chronic condition as one with a low 
      ratio, below a defined threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic health problems tend to 
      have longer duration EoCs, proportionately, across populations. This result is 
      expected, but we found important similarities and differences which make defining 
      a problem as chronic on the basis of time rather difficult. The ratio of 
      incidence to prevalence rates has potential to categorise health problems into 
      acute or chronic categories, at different ratio thresholds (such as 20, 30 or 
      50%). It seems to perform well in this study of three family practice 
      populations, and is proposed to the scientific community for further evaluation.

TI  - Response to past depression treatments is not accurately recalled: comparison of 
      structured recall and patient health questionnaire scores in medical records.
PG  - 1503-8
LID - 10.4088/JCP.12m07883 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessing response to prior depression treatments is common in 
      research and clinical practice, but few data are available regarding accuracy of 
      patient recall. Data from a population-based survey were linked to electronic 
      medical records to examine agreement between patients' recalled treatment 
      response and depression severity scores in the medical records. METHOD: 
      Electronic medical records from a large health system identified 1,878 adult 
      patients with 2 or more episodes of clinician-diagnosed major depressive disorder 
      or dysthymia between January 2005 and December 2009 (diagnoses had been recorded 
      using ICD-9 codes). These potential participants were mailed an invitation 
      letter, and, of these, 578 completed an online or mailed survey including 
      structured recall of response to each prior depression treatment, rating both 
      global improvement during treatment and improvement specifically attributed to 
      treatment. For 269 of the survey participants, at least 1 treatment episode could 
      be unambiguously linked to both pretreatment and posttreatment Patient Health 
      Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scores in the electronic medical records. 
      Analyses examined the agreement between patients' recall of treatment response 
      and response according to PHQ-9 scores from the medical records. RESULTS: 
      Agreement between recall and the medical records was poor for both overall 
      improvement following treatment (κ = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.00-0.19) and improvement 
      attributed to treatment (κ = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.00-0.25). Agreement remained poor 
      when the sample was limited to medication treatment episodes, episodes lasting 3 
      months or more, or episodes for which the participant was "very sure" of his or 
      her ability to recall. Agreement reached a fair level only for episodes in the 6 
      months prior to the survey, for both overall improvement (κ = 0.23; 95% CI, 
      0.08-0.39) and improvement attributed to treatment (κ = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.12-0.59). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients' recall of response to past depression treatments agrees 
      poorly with data from medical records. Interview assessment of prior treatment 
      response may not be a useful tool for research or clinical practice.

AB  - Existing data sources for heart failure research offer advantages and 
      disadvantages for CER. Clinical registries collect detailed information about 
      disease presentation, treatment, and outcomes on a large number of patients and 
      provide the "real-world" population that is the hallmark of CER. Data are not 
      collected longitudinally, however, and follow-up is often limited. Large 
      administrative datasets provide the broadest population coverage with 
      longitudinal outcomes follow-up but lack clinical detail. Linking clinical 
      registries with other databases to assess longitudinal outcomes holds great 
      promise. The Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research 
      recommends further efforts on longitudinal linking of administrative or EHR-based 
      databases, patient registries, private sector databases (particularly those with 
      commercially insured populations that are not covered under federal and state 
      databases), and other relevant data sources containing pharmacy, laboratory, 
      adverse events, and mortality information. Advancing the infrastructure to 
      provide robust, scientific data resources for patient-centered CER must remain a 
      priority.

PG  - 507-15
LID - 10.3414/ME11-01-0064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a model as a starting-point for developing a 
      problem-oriented clinical notes application as a generic component of an 
      Electronic Health Record (EHR). METHODS: We used the generic conceptualization of 
      Weed's problem-oriented medical record (POMR) to link progress notes to problems, 
      and the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP) headings to classify 
      elements of these notes. Health Level 7 (HL7) Version 3 and Unified Modeling 
      Language (UML) were used for modeling. We looked especially at the role of 
      Conditions and Concerns, and how to model these to document clinical reasoning. 
      RESULTS: We developed a generic HL7-based model for progress notes. In this model 
      the specific clinical note has a condition as its reason. An assertion can be 
      made about a condition. Any condition, observation or procedure can be a concern 
      that has to be tracked. Utmost important is the relationship between constituting 
      parts of a progress note and specially between progress notes by linking a 
      progress note to conditions that are part of an earlier progress note. From this 
      model a comprehensive hierarchical condition tree can be built. Several views, 
      such as chronological, SOAP and condition-oriented, are possible. The clinical 
      notes application is used in daily clinical practice. The model meets explicit 
      design criteria and clinical needs. CONCLUSIONS: With the comprehensive HL7 
      standard it is possible to model and map progress notes using SOAP headings and 
      POMR methodology. We have developed a generic, flexible and applicable paradigm 
      by using acts for each assessment that refer to a condition (1), by separating 
      conditions from concerns (2), and by an extensive use of the working list act 
      (3).

TI  - Frequency, duration and predictors of bronchiolitis episodes of care among 
      infants ≥32 weeks gestation in a large integrated healthcare system: a 
      retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 144
LID - 10.1186/1472-6963-12-144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis is common in the first two years of life and is the 
      most frequent cause of hospitalization in this age group. No previous studies 
      have used an episode-of-care analysis to describe the frequency, duration, and 
      predictors of bronchiolitis episodes of care during the first two years. METHODS: 
      We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 123,264 infants ≥32 weeks gestation 
      born at 6 Northern California Kaiser Permanente hospitals between 1996 and 2002. 
      We used electronic medical records to concatenate hospital, emergency department 
      and outpatient health care encounters for bronchiolitis into discrete episodes of 
      care. We used descriptive statistics to report frequency and duration of 
      bronchiolitis episodes and used logistic regression to assess the effect of 
      gestational age and other clinical and demographic predictors on the outcome of 
      bronchiolitis episodes. RESULTS: Among all infants, the rate of bronchiolitis 
      episodes was 162 per 1000 children during the first 2 years of life; 
      approximately 40% required >1 day of medical attention with a mean duration of 
      7.0 ± 5.9 days. Prematurity was associated with increased risk of bronchiolitis 
      episodes and longer duration. Bronchiolitis episodes rates per 1000 infants were 
      246 for 32-33 weeks gestational age, 204 for 34-36 weeks, and 148-178 for 
      >36 weeks. Male gender, African-American and Hispanic race/ethnicity, and 
      parental history of asthma were associated with an increased risk of having a 
      bronchiolitis episode and/or longer duration. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchiolitis episodes 
      of care are frequent during the first two years of life and the duration ranges 
      from 1 to 27 days. Prematurity was associated with more frequent and longer 
      duration of bronchiolitis episodes of care, which may reflect illness severity 
      and/or perceived vulnerability.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a crowdsourcing methodology for knowledge base 
      construction: identifying relationships between clinical problems and 
      medications.
PG  - 713-8
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000852 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel, crowdsourcing method for generating a knowledge 
      base of problem-medication pairs that takes advantage of manually asserted links 
      between medications and problems. METHODS: Through iterative review, we developed 
      metrics to estimate the appropriateness of manually entered problem-medication 
      links for inclusion in a knowledge base that can be used to infer previously 
      unasserted links between problems and medications. RESULTS: Clinicians manually 
      linked 231,223 medications (55.30% of prescribed medications) to problems within 
      the electronic health record, generating 41,203 distinct problem-medication 
      pairs, although not all were accurate. We developed methods to evaluate the 
      accuracy of the pairs, and after limiting the pairs to those meeting an estimated 
      95% appropriateness threshold, 11,166 pairs remained. The pairs in the knowledge 
      base accounted for 183,127 total links asserted (76.47% of all links). 
      Retrospective application of the knowledge base linked 68,316 medications not 
      previously linked by a clinician to an indicated problem (36.53% of unlinked 
      medications). Expert review of the combined knowledge base, including inferred 
      and manually linked problem-medication pairs, found a sensitivity of 65.8% and a 
      specificity of 97.9%. CONCLUSION: Crowdsourcing is an effective, inexpensive 
      method for generating a knowledge base of problem-medication pairs that is 
      automatically mapped to local terminologies, up-to-date, and reflective of local 
      prescribing practices and trends.

PG  - 266-78
LID - 10.1093/intqhc/mzs007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to develop an electronic adverse event (AE) screening tool 
      applicable to acute care hospital episodes for patients admitted with chronic 
      heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia. DESIGN: Consensus building using a modified 
      Delphi method and descriptive analysis of hospital discharge data. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Consultant physicians in general medicine (n = 38). INTERVENTION: In-hospital 
      acquired (C-prefix) diagnoses associated with CHF and pneumonia admissions to 230 
      hospitals in Victoria, Australia, were extracted from the Victorian Admitted 
      Episodes Data Set between July 2004 and June 2007. A 9-point rating scale was 
      used to prioritize diagnoses acquired during hospitalization (routinely coded as 
      a 'C-prefix' diagnosis to distinguish from diagnoses present on admission) for 
      inclusion within an AE screening tool. Diagnoses rated a group median score 
      between 7 and 9 by the physician panel were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Selection of C-prefix diagnoses with a group median rating of 7-9 in a screening 
      tool, and the level of physician agreement, as assessed using the Interpercentile 
      Range Adjusted for Symmetry. RESULTS: Of 697 initial C-prefix diagnoses, there 
      were high levels of agreement to include 113 (16.2%) in the AE screening tool. 
      Using these selected diagnoses, a potential AE was flagged in 14% of all 
      admissions for the two index conditions. Intra-rater reliability for each 
      clinician ranged from kappa 0.482 to 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of physician 
      agreement was obtained in selecting in-hospital diagnoses for inclusion in an AE 
      screening tool based on routinely collected data. These results support further 
      tool validation.

TI  - An international comparative family medicine study of the Transition Project data 
      from the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia. Is family medicine an international 
      discipline? Comparing incidence and prevalence rates of reasons for encounter and 
      diagnostic titles of episodes of care across populations.
PG  - 283-98
LID - 10.1093/fampra/cmr098 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This is a study of the epidemiology of family medicine (FM) in 
      three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia. Incidence and 
      prevalence rates, especially of reasons for encounter (RfEs) and episode labels, 
      are compared. METHODOLOGY: Participating family doctors (FDs) recorded details of 
      all their patient contacts in an episode of care (EoC) structure using electronic 
      patient records based on the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), 
      collecting data on all elements of the doctor-patient encounter. RfEs presented 
      by the patient, all FD interventions and the diagnostic labels (EoCs labels) 
      recorded for each encounter were classified with ICPC (ICPC-2-E in Malta and 
      Serbia and ICPC-1 in the Netherlands). RESULTS: The content of family practice in 
      the three population databases, incidence and prevalence rates of the common top 
      20 RfEs and EoCs in the three databases are given. CONCLUSIONS: Data that are 
      collected with an episode-based model define incidence and prevalence rates much 
      more precisely. Incidence and prevalence rates reflect the content of the 
      doctor-patient encounter in FM but only from a superficial perspective. However, 
      we found evidence of an international FM core content and a local FM content 
      reflected by important similarities in such distributions. FM is a complex 
      discipline, and the reduction of the content of a consultation into one or more 
      medical diagnoses, ignoring the patient's RfE, is a coarse reduction, which lacks 
      power to fully characterize a population's health care needs. In fact, RfE 
      distributions seem to be more consistent between populations than distributions 
      of EoCs are, in many respects.

      To determine whether a clinical alerting system, which uses inference rules to 
      notify providers of undocumented problems, improves problem list documentation. 
      STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Inference rules for 17 conditions were constructed and 
      an electronic health record-based intervention was evaluated to improve problem 
      documentation. A cluster randomized trial was conducted of 11 participating 
      clinics affiliated with a large academic medical center, totaling 28 primary care 
      clinical areas, with 14 receiving the intervention and 14 as controls. The 
      intervention was a clinical alert directed to the provider that suggested adding 
      a problem to the electronic problem list based on inference rules. The primary 
      outcome measure was acceptance of the alert. The number of study problems added 
      in each arm as a pre-specified secondary outcome was also assessed. Data were 
      collected during 6-month pre-intervention (11/2009-5/2010) and intervention 
      (5/2010-11/2010) periods. RESULTS: 17,043 alerts were presented, of which 41.1% 
      were accepted. In the intervention arm, providers documented significantly more 
      study problems (adjusted OR=3.4, p<0.001), with an absolute difference of 6277 
      additional problems. In the intervention group, 70.4% of all study problems were 
      added via the problem list alerts. Significant increases in problem notation were 
      observed for 13 of 17 conditions. CONCLUSION: Problem inference alerts 
      significantly increase notation of important patient problems in primary care, 
      which in turn has the potential to facilitate quality improvement. TRIAL

AB  - Hospital discharge summaries ensure treatment continuity after hospital 
      discharge. In Switzerland discharge letters are a celebrated custom and a tool 
      for training young colleagues. The primary purpose is to guarantee high-quality 
      care of patients treated by hospital staff and general practitioners. From the 
      perspective of the patient's general practitioner discharge summaries should 
      convey current and accurate medically important patient data to the physician 
      responsible for follow-up care. In the era of highly developed electronic data 
      transfer and introduction of diagnose related groups (DRGs), it will be necessary 
      to transmit hospital discharge information selectively to different target 
      groups. Nevertheless data protection and medical secret must be complied with.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the VA/Kaiser and NLM CORE problem subsets: an empirical 
      study based on problem frequency.
PG  - 1532-40
AB  - The problem list is a critical component of the electronic medical record, with 
      implications for clinical care, provider communication, clinical decision 
      support, quality measurement and research. However, many of its benefits depend 
      on the use of coded terminologies. Two standard terminologies (ICD-9 and 
      SNOMED-CT) are available for problem documentation, and two SNOMED-CT subsets 
      (VA/KP and CORE) are available for SNOMED-CT users. We set out to examine these 
      subsets, characterize their overlap and measure their coverage. We applied the 
      subsets to a random sample of 100,000 records from Brigham and Women's Hospital 
      to determine the proportion of problems covered. Though CORE is smaller (5,814 
      terms vs. 17,761 terms for VA/KP), 94.8% of coded problem entries from BWH were 
      in the CORE subset, while only 84.0% of entries had matches in VA/KP (p<0.001). 
      Though both subsets had reasonable coverage, CORE was superior in our sample, and 
      had fewer clinically significant gaps.

TI  - Automatically detecting problem list omissions of type 2 diabetes cases using 
      electronic medical records.
PG  - 1062-9
AB  - As part of a large-scale project to use DNA biorepositories linked with 
      electronic medical record (EMR) data for research, we developed and validated an 
      algorithm to identify type 2 diabetes cases in the EMR. Though the algorithm was 
      originally created to support clinical research, we have subsequently re-applied 
      it to determine if it could also be used to identify problem list gaps. We 
      examined the problem lists of the cases that the algorithm identified in order to 
      determine if a structured code for diabetes was present. We found that only just 
      over half of patients identified by the algorithm had a corresponding structured 
      code entered in their problem list. We analyze characteristics of this patient 
      population and identify possible reasons for the problem list omissions. We 
      conclude that application of such algorithms to the EMR can improve the quality 
      of the problem list, thereby supporting satisfaction of Meaningful Use 
      guidelines.

AB  - Increasing use of electronic health records requires comprehensive 
      patient-centered views of clinical data. We describe a prototype knowledge base 
      and SMART app that facilitates organization of patient medications by clinical 
      problems, comprising a preliminary step in building such patient-centered views. 
      The knowledge base includes 7,164,444 distinct problem-medication links, 
      generated from RxNorm, SNOMED CT, and NDF-RT within the UMLS Metathesaurus. In an 
      evaluation of the knowledge base applied to 5000 de-identified patient records, 
      22.4% of medications linked to an entry in the patient's active problem list, 
      compared to 32.6% of medications manually linked by providers; 46.5% of total 
      links were unique to the knowledge base, not added by providers. Expert review of 
      a random patient subset estimated a sensitivity of 37.1% and specificity of 
      98.9%. The SMART API successfully utilized the knowledge base to generate 
      problem-medication links for test patients. Future work is necessary to improve 
      knowledge base sensitivity and efficiency.

TI  - Testing Three Problem List Terminologies in a simulated data entry environment.
PG  - 445-54
AB  - Three Problem List Terminologies (PLT) were tested using a web-based application 
      simulating a clinical data entry environment to evaluate coverage and coding 
      efficiency. The three PLTs were: the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT, a 
      clinical subset extracted from the full SNOMED CT and the PLT currently used at 
      the Mayo Clinic. Candidate problem statements were randomly extracted from free 
      text problem list entries contained in two electronic medical record systems. 
      Physician reviewers searched for concepts in one of the three PLTs that most 
      closely matched a problem statement. Altogether 45 reviewers reviewed 15 problems 
      each. The coverage of the much smaller CORE Subset was comparable to Clinical 
      SNOMED for combined exact or partial matches. The CORE Subset required the 
      shortest time to find a concept. This may be related to the smaller size of the 
      pick lists for the CORE Subset.

      content-based image retrieval.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-11-68 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiologists' training is based on intensive practice and can be 
      improved with the use of diagnostic training systems. However, existing systems 
      typically require laboriously prepared training cases and lack integration into 
      the clinical environment with a proper learning scenario. Consequently, 
      diagnostic training systems advancing decision-making skills are not well 
      established in radiological education. METHODS: We investigated didactic concepts 
      and appraised methods appropriate to the radiology domain, as follows: (i) Adult 
      learning theories stress the importance of work-related practice gained in a team 
      of problem-solvers; (ii) Case-based reasoning (CBR) parallels the human 
      problem-solving process; (iii) Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) can be useful 
      for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). To overcome the known drawbacks of existing 
      learning systems, we developed the concept of image-based case retrieval for 
      radiological education (IBCR-RE). The IBCR-RE diagnostic training is embedded 
      into a didactic framework based on the Seven Jump approach, which is well 
      established in problem-based learning (PBL). In order to provide a learning 
      environment that is as similar as possible to radiological practice, we have 
      analysed the radiological workflow and environment. RESULTS: We mapped the 
      IBCR-RE diagnostic training approach into the Image Retrieval in Medical 
      Applications (IRMA) framework, resulting in the proposed concept of the IRMAdiag 
      training application. IRMAdiag makes use of the modular structure of IRMA and 
      comprises (i) the IRMA core, i.e., the IRMA CBIR engine; and (ii) the IRMAcon 
      viewer. We propose embedding IRMAdiag into hospital information technology (IT) 
      infrastructure using the standard protocols Digital Imaging and Communications in 
      Medicine (DICOM) and Health Level Seven (HL7). Furthermore, we present a case 
      description and a scheme of planned evaluations to comprehensively assess the 
      system. CONCLUSIONS: The IBCR-RE paradigm incorporates a novel combination of 
      essential aspects of diagnostic learning in radiology: (i) Provision of 
      work-relevant experiences in a training environment integrated into the 
      radiologist's working context; (ii) Up-to-date training cases that do not require 
      cumbersome preparation because they are provided by routinely generated 
      electronic medical records; (iii) Support of the way adults learn while remaining 
      suitable for the patient- and problem-oriented nature of medicine. Future work 
      will address unanswered questions to complete the implementation of the IRMAdiag 
      trainer.

TI  - Handling anticipated exceptions in clinical care: investigating clinician use of 
      'exit strategies' in an electronic health records system.
PG  - 883-9
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000118 [doi]
AB  - Unpredictable yet frequently occurring exception situations pervade clinical 
      care. Handling them properly often requires aberrant actions temporarily 
      departing from normal practice. In this study, the authors investigated several 
      exception-handling procedures provided in an electronic health records system for 
      facilitating clinical documentation, which the authors refer to as 'data entry 
      exit strategies.' Through a longitudinal analysis of computer-recorded usage 
      data, the authors found that (1) utilization of the exit strategies was not 
      affected by postimplementation system maturity or patient visit volume, 
      suggesting clinicians' needs to 'exit' unwanted situations are persistent; and 
      (2) clinician type and gender are strong predictors of exit-strategy usage. 
      Drilldown analyses further revealed that the exit strategies were judiciously 
      used and enabled actions that would be otherwise difficult or impossible. 
      However, many data entries recorded via them could have been 'properly' 
      documented, yet were not, and a considerable proportion containing temporary or 
      incomplete information was never subsequently amended. These findings may have 
      significant implications for the design of safer and more user-friendly 
      point-of-care information systems for healthcare.

TI  - A method and knowledge base for automated inference of patient problems from 
      structured data in an electronic medical record.
PG  - 859-67
LID - 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate knowledge of a patient's medical problems is critical for 
      clinical decision making, quality measurement, research, billing and clinical 
      decision support. Common structured sources of problem information include the 
      patient problem list and billing data; however, these sources are often 
      inaccurate or incomplete. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate methods of 
      automatically inferring patient problems from clinical and billing data, and to 
      provide a knowledge base for inferring problems. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We 
      identified 17 target conditions and designed and validated a set of rules for 
      identifying patient problems based on medications, laboratory results, billing 
      codes, and vital signs. A panel of physicians provided input on a preliminary set 
      of rules. Based on this input, we tested candidate rules on a sample of 100,000 
      patient records to assess their performance compared to gold standard manual 
      chart review. The physician panel selected a final rule for each condition, which 
      was validated on an independent sample of 100,000 records to assess its accuracy. 
      RESULTS: Seventeen rules were developed for inferring patient problems. Analysis 
      using a validation set of 100,000 randomly selected patients showed high 
      sensitivity (range: 62.8-100.0%) and positive predictive value (range: 
      79.8-99.6%) for most rules. Overall, the inference rules performed better than 
      using either the problem list or billing data alone. CONCLUSION: We developed and 
      validated a set of rules for inferring patient problems. These rules have a 
      variety of applications, including clinical decision support, care improvement, 
      augmentation of the problem list, and identification of patients for research 
      cohorts.

TI  - Developing an electronic health record (EHR) for methadone treatment recording 
      and decision support.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-11-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper, we give an overview of methadone treatment in Ireland 
      and outline the rationale for designing an electronic health record (EHR) with 
      extensibility, interoperability and decision support functionality. Incorporating 
      several international standards, a conceptual model applying a problem orientated 
      approach in a hierarchical structure has been proposed for building the EHR. 
      METHODS: A set of archetypes has been designed in line with the current best 
      practice and clinical guidelines which guide the information-gathering process. A 
      web-based data entry system has been implemented, incorporating elements of the 
      paper-based prescription form, while at the same time facilitating the decision 
      support function. RESULTS: The use of archetypes was found to capture the ever 
      changing requirements in the healthcare domain and externalises them in 
      constrained data structures. The solution is extensible enabling the EHR to cover 
      medicine management in general as per the programme of the HRB Centre for Primary 
      Care Research. CONCLUSIONS: The data collected via this Irish system can be 
      aggregated into a larger dataset, if necessary, for analysis and 
      evidence-gathering, since we adopted the openEHR standard. It will be later 
      extended to include the functionalities of prescribing drugs other than methadone 
      along with the research agenda at the HRB Centre for Primary Care Research in 
      Ireland.

TI  - Data from clinical notes: a perspective on the tension between structure and 
      flexible documentation.
PG  - 181-6
LID - 10.1136/jamia.2010.007237 [doi]
AB  - Clinical documentation is central to patient care. The success of electronic 
      health record system adoption may depend on how well such systems support 
      clinical documentation. A major goal of integrating clinical documentation into 
      electronic heath record systems is to generate reusable data. As a result, there 
      has been an emphasis on deploying computer-based documentation systems that 
      prioritize direct structured documentation. Research has demonstrated that 
      healthcare providers value different factors when writing clinical notes, such as 
      narrative expressivity, amenability to the existing workflow, and usability. The 
      authors explore the tension between expressivity and structured clinical 
      documentation, review methods for obtaining reusable data from clinical notes, 
      and recommend that healthcare providers be able to choose how to document patient 
      care based on workflow and note content needs. When reusable data are needed from 
      notes, providers can use structured documentation or rely on post-hoc text 
      processing to produce structured data, as appropriate.

TI  - Continuity of care and colorectal cancer screening by Vietnamese American 
      patients.
PG  - 1125-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates among Asian Americans are 
      30-50% lower than among Whites. Using practice management and electronic medical 
      records data from a community health center, we examined the association of CRC 
      screening with continuity of care and comorbidity. These variables have not 
      previously been studied in Asian American and limited-English proficient 
      populations. METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, we extracted data in 2009 on 
      age-eligible Vietnamese patients who had one or more clinic visits in the prior 
      24 months. Our analysis examined associations between CRC screening (per current 
      US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines) and clinic site, demographics, 
      insurance status, continuity of care, comorbidities, and provider 
      characteristics. RESULTS: We identified a total of 1,016 eligible patients (604 
      at Clinic 1 and 412 at Clinic 2). Adherence to CRC screening was lower for 
      patients who were male; lacked insurance; had only one medical visit in the past 
      12 months; and had no assigned primary care provider. Our multivariable models 
      showed higher screening rates among patients who were female; had public health 
      insurance; and had more than one medical visit in the past 12 months, regardless 
      of high or low continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between 
      higher continuity of care and CRC screening. Additional primary care systems 
      research is needed to guide cancer screening interventions for limited-English 
      proficient patients.

LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626012 [doi]
AB  - Most organizations exchange, collect, store and process data over the Internet. 
      Many hospital networks deploy Web services to send and receive patient 
      information. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is the most usable 
      communication protocol for Web services. XML is the standard encoding language of 
      SOAP messages. However, the major drawback of XML messages is the high network 
      traffic caused by large overheads. In this paper, two XML-aware compressors are 
      suggested to compress patient messages stemming from any data transactions 
      between Web clients and servers. The proposed compression techniques are based on 
      the XML structure concepts and use both fixed-length and Huffman encoding methods 
      for translating the XML message tree. Experiments show that they outperform all 
      the conventional compression methods and can save tremendous amount of network 
      bandwidth.

TI  - The UMLS-CORE project: a study of the problem list terminologies used in large 
      healthcare institutions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study existing problem list terminologies (PLTs), and to identify a 
      subset of concepts based on standard terminologies that occur frequently in 
      problem list data. DESIGN: Problem list terms and their usage frequencies were 
      collected from large healthcare institutions. MEASUREMENT: The pattern of usage 
      of the terms was analyzed. The local terms were mapped to the Unified Medical 
      Language System (UMLS). Based on the mapped UMLS concepts, the degree of overlap 
      between the PLTs was analyzed. RESULTS: Six institutions submitted 76,237 terms 
      and their usage frequencies in 14 million patients. The distribution of usage was 
      highly skewed. On average, 21% of unique terms already covered 95% of usage. The 
      most frequently used 14,395 terms, representing the union of terms that covered 
      95% of usage in each institution, were exhaustively mapped to the UMLS. 13,261 
      terms were successfully mapped to 6776 UMLS concepts. Less frequently used terms 
      were generally less 'mappable' to the UMLS. The mean pairwise overlap of the PLTs 
      was only 21% (median 19%). Concepts that were shared among institutions were used 
      eight times more often than concepts unique to one institution. A SNOMED Problem 
      List Subset of frequently used problem list concepts was identified. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Most of the frequently used problem list terms could be found in standard 
      terminologies. The overlap between existing PLTs was low. The use of the SNOMED 
      Problem List Subset will save developmental effort, reduce variability of PLTs, 
      and enhance interoperability of problem list data.

      surveillance using disparate healthcare databases.
PG  - 652-62
LID - 10.1136/jamia.2009.002477 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Active drug safety surveillance may be enhanced by analysis of 
      multiple observational healthcare databases, including administrative claims and 
      electronic health records. The objective of this study was to develop and 
      evaluate a common data model (CDM) enabling rapid, comparable, systematic 
      analyses across disparate observational data sources to identify and evaluate the 
      effects of medicines. DESIGN: The CDM uses a person-centric design, with 
      attributes for demographics, drug exposures, and condition occurrence. Drug eras, 
      constructed to represent periods of persistent drug use, are derived from 
      available elements from pharmacy dispensings, prescriptions written, and other 
      medication history. Condition eras aggregate diagnoses that occur within a single 
      episode of care. Drugs and conditions from source data are mapped to biomedical 
      ontologies to standardize terminologies and enable analyses of higher-order 
      effects. MEASUREMENTS: The CDM was applied to two source types: an administrative 
      claims and an electronic medical record database. Descriptive statistics were 
      used to evaluate transformation rules. Two case studies demonstrate the ability 
      of the CDM to enable standard analyses across disparate sources: analyses of 
      persons exposed to rofecoxib and persons with an acute myocardial infarction. 
      RESULTS: Over 43 million persons, with nearly 1 billion drug exposures and 3.7 
      billion condition occurrences from both databases were successfully transformed 
      into the CDM. An analysis routine applied to transformed data from each database 
      produced consistent, comparable results. CONCLUSION: A CDM can normalize the 
      structure and content of disparate observational data, enabling standardized 
      analyses that are meaningfully comparable when assessing the effects of 
      medicines.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop, implement, and evaluate the use of electronic medical 
      records (EMRs) in disease state management activities to teach pharmacy students 
      patient-centered care skills. DESIGN: Faculty created 12 patient cases and an EMR 
      for each simulated patient. Students used the information in the EMR to confirm 
      the presence of a disease in their patient; to design and monitor an 
      evidence-based patient-centered care plan, and document their assessment, 
      medication, and monitoring recommendations; and to follow up in a SOAP 
      (subjective, objective, assessment, plan) note format within the EMR. ASSESSMENT: 
      A precourse and postcourse survey instrument was administered to assess students' 
      perceived gains in knowledge and attitudes regarding the use of EMRs for learning 
      patient-centered care skills. A grading rubric was used to evaluate each SOAP 
      note. CONCLUSION: Implementation of disease state management activities involving 
      EMRs improved pharmacy students' patient care skills.

TI  - Evaluation of response time delay of a pen-tablet system in thin-client computing 
      environments: implications for usability.
PG  - 47-56
AB  - Changeover from the traditional paper-based patient records to the computerized 
      patient records has been spreading rapidly in medical facilities. Since ordinary 
      input devices such as a keyboard and mouse are often thought insufficient for the 
      needs of medical workers using electronic patient records (EPR) compared with 
      traditional pens and paper-based patient records, a pen-tablet system (PTS) as a 
      digital pen interface tends to be used instead. On the other hand, with the 
      growing adoption of thin-client computing (TCC) in medical facilities, the 
      usability of PTS with TCC has come to be a concern because of possible reduction 
      of the usability due to delays of response time occurring in TCC environments. To 
      analyze the factors that influence the usability of PTS with TCC, the authors 
      focused on the relationship between length and its scattering of the response 
      time delay. The results indicated that the delay scattering could be a more 
      influencing factor than the delay length itself and that values of the scattering 
      should be within approximately 35 milliseconds for the best usability. This study 
      would provide useful indicators for evaluating the usability of PTS in 
      incorporating it into the EPR system with TCC environments.

      surveillance data from general practices and sexually transmitted infection 
      centers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) care in the Netherlands is 
      primarily provided by general practitioners (GPs) and specialized STI centers. 
      STI surveillance is based on data from STI centers, which show increasing numbers 
      of clients. Data from a GP morbidity surveillance network were used to 
      investigate the distribution in the provision of STI care and the usefulness of 
      GP data in surveillance. METHODS: Data on STI-related episodes and STI diagnoses 
      based on ICPC codes and, for chlamydia, prescriptions, were obtained from GP 
      electronic medical records (EMRs) of the GP network and compared to data from STI 
      centers from 2002 to 2007. Incidence rates were estimated for the total 
      population in the Netherlands. RESULTS: The incidence of STI-consultations and 
      -diagnoses increased substantially in recent years, both at GPs and STI centers. 
      The increase in consultations was larger than the increase in diagnoses; 
      Chlamydia incidence rose especially at STI centers. GPs were responsible for 70% 
      of STI-related episodes and 80-85% of STI diagnoses. STI centers attract 
      relatively younger and more often male STI-patients than GPs. Symptomatic STIs 
      like Herpes genitalis and genital warts were more frequently diagnosed at GPs and 
      chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis at STI centers. CONCLUSIONS: GPs fulfill an 
      important role in STI care, complementary to STI centers. Case definitions of STI 
      could be improved, particularly by including laboratory results in EMRs. The 
      contribution of primary care is often overlooked in STI health care. Including 
      estimates from GP EMRs can improve the surveillance of STIs.

TI  - Sixteen years of ICPC use in Norwegian primary care: looking through the facts.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-10-11 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The International Classification for Primary Care (ICPC) standard 
      aims to facilitate simultaneous and longitudinal comparisons of clinical primary 
      care practice within and across country borders; it is also used for 
      administrative purposes. This study evaluates the use of the original ICPC-1 and 
      the more complete ICPC-2 Norwegian versions in electronic patient records. 
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of approximately 1.5 million ICPC 
      codes and diagnoses that were collected over a 16-year period at 12 primary care 
      sites in Norway. In the first phase of this period (transition phase, 1992-1999) 
      physicians were allowed to not use an ICPC code in their practice while in the 
      second phase (regular phase, 2000-2008) the use of an ICPC code was mandatory. 
      The ICPC codes and diagnoses defined a problem event for each patient in the 
      PROblem-oriented electronic MEDical record (PROMED). The main outcome measure of 
      our analysis was the percentage of problem events in PROMEDs with inappropriate 
      (or missing) ICPC codes and of diagnoses that did not map the latest ICPC-2 
      classification. Specific problem areas (pneumonia, anaemia, tonsillitis and 
      diabetes) were examined in the same context. RESULTS: Codes were missing in 6.2% 
      of the problem events; incorrect codes were observed in 4.0% of the problem 
      events and text mismatch between the diagnoses and the expected ICPC-2 diagnoses 
      text in 53.8% of the problem events. Missing codes were observed only during the 
      transition phase while incorrect and inappropriate codes were used all over the 
      16-year period. The physicians created diagnoses that did not exist in ICPC. 
      These 'new' diagnoses were used with varying frequency; many of them were used 
      only once. Inappropriate ICPC-2 codes were also observed in the selected problem 
      areas and for both phases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strongly suggest that 
      physicians did not adhere to the ICPC standard due to its incompleteness, i.e. 
      lack of many clinically important diagnoses. This indicates that ICPC is 
      inappropriate for the classification of problem events and the clinical practice 
      in primary care.

      health problem list.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/1472-6947-10-10 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health problem lists are a key component of electronic health records 
      and are instrumental in the development of decision-support systems that 
      encourage best practices and optimal patient safety. Most health problem lists 
      require initial clinical information to be entered manually and few integrate 
      information across care providers and institutions. This study assesses the 
      accuracy of a novel approach to create an inter-institutional automated health 
      problem list in a computerized medical record (MOXXI) that integrates three 
      sources of information for an individual patient: diagnostic codes from medical 
      services claims from all treating physicians, therapeutic indications from 
      electronic prescriptions, and single-indication drugs. METHODS: Data for this 
      study were obtained from 121 general practitioners and all medical services 
      provided for 22,248 of their patients. At the opening of a patient's file, all 
      health problems detected through medical service utilization or single-indication 
      drug use were flagged to the physician in the MOXXI system. Each new arising 
      health problem were presented as 'potential' and physicians were prompted to 
      specify if the health problem was valid (Y) or not (N) or if they preferred to 
      reassess its validity at a later time. RESULTS: A total of 263,527 health 
      problems, representing 891 unique problems, were identified for the group of 
      22,248 patients. Medical services claims contributed to the majority of problems 
      identified (77%), followed by therapeutic indications from electronic 
      prescriptions (14%), and single-indication drugs (9%). Physicians actively chose 
      to assess 41.7% (n = 106,950) of health problems. Overall, 73% of the problems 
      assessed were considered valid; 42% originated from medical service diagnostic 
      codes, 11% from single indication drugs, and 47% from prescription indications. 
      Twelve percent of problems identified through other treating physicians were 
      considered valid compared to 28% identified through study physician claims. 
      CONCLUSION: Automation of an inter-institutional problem list added over half of 
      all validated problems to the health problem list of which 12% were generated by 
      conditions treated by other physicians. Automating the integration of existing 
      information sources provides timely access to accurate and relevant health 
      problem information. It may also accelerate the uptake and use of electronic 
      medical record systems.

TI  - Enhancing laboratory report contents to improve outpatient management of test 
      results.
PG  - 99-103
LID - 10.1197/jamia.M3391 [doi]
AB  - In today's environment, providers are extremely time-constrained. Assembling 
      relevant contextual data to make decisions on laboratory results can take a 
      significant amount of time from the day. The Regenstrief Institute has created a 
      system which leverages data within Indiana Health Information Exchange's (IHIE's) 
      repository, the Indiana Network for Patient Care (INPC), to provide 
      well-organized and contextual information on returning laboratory results to 
      outpatient providers. The system described here uses data extracted from INPC to 
      add historical test results, medication-dispensing events, visit information, and 
      clinical reminders to traditional laboratory result reports. These "Enhanced 
      Laboratory Reports" (ELRs) are seamlessly delivered to outpatient practices 
      connected through IHIE via the DOCS4DOCS clinical messaging service. All 
      practices, including those without electronic medical record systems, can receive 
      ELRs. In this paper, the design and implementation issues in creating this system 
      are discussed, and generally favorable preliminary results of attitudes by 
      providers towards ELRs are reported.

TI  - Interoperability of personal health records.
PG  - 1726-9
LID - 10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333559 [doi]
AB  - Personal Health Records (PHR's) and related services are emerging rapidly. 
      Currently, most PHR's are isolated and do not communicate with other systems. 
      Standards for interoperability exist, but they are oriented towards clinical 
      applications. However, a substantial part of a typical PHR consists of 
      non-clinical information such as a health diary. The present paper highlights the 
      requirements related to exchanging non-clinical PHR information between services 
      and shows how this information exchange can be accomplished. The approach 
      utilizes a SOAP message for carrying the actual PHR content in a structure 
      referred as Health Diary Entry (HDE) document. The HDE document provides 
      mechanisms to bind the contents to external vocabularies and ontologies to 
      achieve semantic interoperability. The approach was successfully tested in the 
      context of an occupational health pilot, in which data contents from several 
      health and wellness applications were merged into a common database.

TI  - Options for diabetes management in sub-Saharan Africa with an electronic medical 
      record system.
PG  - 11-22
LID - 10.3414/ME09-01-0021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase of diabetes prevalence of up to 80% is predicted in 
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by 2025 exceeding the worldwide 55%. Mortality rates of 
      diabetes and HIV/AIDS are similar. Diabetes shares several common factors with 
      HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The latter two health 
      problems have been efficiently managed by an open source electronic medical 
      record system (EMRS) in Latin America. Therefore a similar solution for diabetes 
      in SSA could be extremely helpful. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to design and validate 
      a conceptual model for an EMRS to improve diabetes management in SSA making use 
      of the HIV and TB experience. METHODS: A review of the literature addressed 
      diabetes care and management in SSA as well as existing examples of information 
      and communication technology (ICT) use in SSA. Based on a need assessment 
      conducted in SSA a conceptual model based on the traditionally structured 
      healthcare system in SSA was mapped into a three-layer structure. Application 
      modules were derived and a demonstrator programmed based on an open source EMRS. 
      Then the approach was validated by SSA experts. RESULTS: A conceptual model could 
      be specified and validated which enhances a problem-oriented approach to diabetes 
      management processes. The prototyp EMRS demonstrates options for a patient portal 
      and simulation tools for education of health professional and patients in SSA. 
      CONCLUSION: It is possible to find IT solutions for diabetes care in SSA which 
      follow the same efficiency concepts as HIV or TB modules in Latin America. The 
      local efficiency and sustainability of the solution will, however, depend on 
      training and changes in work behavior.

TI  - United States health care reform in 2009: a primer for gastroenterologists.
PG  - 1168-73
LID - 10.1016/j.cgh.2009.07.018 [doi]
AB  - The US health care system is characterized by staggering costs alongside limited 
      access, uneven quality, and subpar health outcomes. Although federal policymakers 
      have long acknowledged this health care crisis, there still has been no 
      fundamental realignment in health care organization or delivery. With a new 
      Presidential Administration and deep economic recession, profound changes now 
      appear imminent. These changes are likely to impact gastroenterologists 
      significantly, including who they treat, how they deliver care, and how they are 
      compensated. This article considers the most likely reforms, including health 
      insurance and the drive toward universal coverage; a shift to reimbursement 
      models that reward quality over the entire episode of care; reorganization of 
      health care delivery around more highly integrated practices, patient-centered 
      medical homes, and accountable care organizations; and electronic health records, 
      comparative effectiveness research, and reporting transparency as necessary tools 
      for implementing systemic change. Finally, anticipating these changes, this 
      article concludes with specific recommendations to enable gastroenterologists to 
      adapt to new practice environments.

AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: The effect of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) use 
      on Patient-Doctor Communication (PDC) has rarely been studied. As data 
      accumulate, the purpose of this article is to review the literature on EMR effect 
      on PDC, to identify recurring themes and to offer preliminary guidelines and 
      future directions for medical education and research. METHOD: A database search 
      was conducted and 14 articles that met inclusion criteria (published in the past 
      10 years, empirical investigations, direct assessment of the EMR impact on 
      patient-doctor communication) were selected for review. A qualitative, grounded 
      theory-like approach was employed to analyse the data. RESULTS: EMR use often has 
      a positive impact on information exchange, but exerts a negative influence on 
      patient centredness. Some physician characteristics such as their computer skills 
      and behavioural style assist in overcoming this negative influence. CONCLUSION: 
      The use of EMR exerts both positive and negative impacts on physician-patient 
      relationships. The negative impacts can be overcome by some simple means as well 
      as better designs of EMR systems and medical education interventions. Physicians' 
      everyday practices of integrating EMR use into the clinical encounter as well as 
      better design of EMR systems and EMR and communication training may facilitate 
      PDC in computerized settings.

TI  - Content and structure of clinical problem lists: a corpus analysis.
PG  - 753-7
AB  - In the interest of designing an automated high-level, longitudinal clinical 
      summary of a patient record, we analyze traditional ways in which medical 
      problems pertaining to the patient are summarized in the electronic health 
      record. The patient problem list has become a commonly used proxy for a summary 
      of patient history and automated methods have been proposed to generate it. 
      However, little research has been conducted on how to structure the problem list 
      in a manner most effective for supporting clinical care. This study analyzes the 
      structure and content of the Past Medical History (PMH) sections of a large 
      corpus of clinical notes, as a proxy for problem lists. Findings show that when 
      listing patients history, physicians convey several semantic types of 
      information, not only problems. Furthermore, they often group related concepts in 
      a single line of the PMH. In contrast, traditional problem lists allow only a 
      simple enumeration of coded terms. Content analysis goes on to reiterate the 
      value of more complex representations as well as provide valuable data and 
      guidelines for automated generation of a clinical summary.

TI  - Building an automated problem list based on natural language processing: lessons 
      learned in the early phase of development.
PG  - 687-91
AB  - Detailed problem lists that comply with JCAHO requirements are important 
      components of electronic health records. Besides improving continuity of care 
      electronic problem lists could serve as foundation infrastructure for clinical 
      trial recruitment, research, biosurveillance and billing informatics modules. 
      However, physicians rarely maintain problem lists. Our team is building a system 
      using MetaMap and UMLS to automatically populate the problem list. We report our 
      early results evaluating the application. Three physicians generated gold 
      standard problem lists for 100 cardiology ambulatory progress notes. Our 
      application had 88% sensitivity and 66% precision using a non-modified UMLS 
      dataset. The systemâs misses concentrated in the group of ambiguous problem list 
      entries (Chi-square=27.12 p<0.0001). In addition to the explicit entries, the 
      notes included 10% implicit entry candidates. MetaMap and UMLS are readily 
      applicable to automate the problem list. Ambiguity in medical documents has 
      consequences for performance evaluation of automated systems.

TI  - Automating the maintenance of problem list documentation using a clinical

PG  - 989
AB  - We designed and tested a clinical decision support system (CDSS) prototype to 
      investigate whether a CDSS that assists matching ordered drugs to problems on the 
      problem list can enhance the maintenance of medications and problem lists in the 
      electronic medical record. We evaluated the capability of this CDSS in 
      medication-problem matching using clinical expert chart audits. The analysis 
      revealed that this CDSS could determine the completeness of medication and 
      problem lists if a mismatch occurs.

TI  - External validation of EPICON: a grouping system for estimating morbidity rates 
      using electronic medical records.
PG  - 770-5
LID - 10.1197/jamia.M2774 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To externally validate EPICON, a computerized system for grouping 
      diagnoses from EMRs in general practice into episodes of care. These episodes can 
      be used for estimating morbidity rates. DESIGN: Comparative observational study. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Morbidity rates from an independent dataset, based on 
      episode-oriented EMRs, were used as the gold standard. The EMRs in this dataset 
      contained diagnoses which were manually grouped by GPs. The authors ungrouped 
      these diagnoses and regrouped them automatically into episodes using EPICON. The 
      authors then used these episodes to estimate morbidity rates that were compared 
      to the gold standard. The differences between the two sets of morbidity rates 
      were calculated and the authors analyzed large as well as structural differences 
      to establish possible causes. RESULTS: In general, the morbidity rates based on 
      EPICON deviate only slightly from the gold standard. Out of 675 diagnoses, 36 
      (5%) were considered to be deviating diagnoses. The deviating diagnoses showed 
      differences for two main reasons: "differences in rules between the two methods 
      of episode construction" and "inadequate performance of EPICON." CONCLUSION: The 
      EPICON system performs well for the large majority of the morbidity rates. We can 
      therefore conclude that EPICON is useful for grouping episodes to estimate 
      morbidity rates using EMRs from general practices. Morbidity rates of diseases 
      with a broad range of symptoms should, however, be interpreted cautiously.

TI  - Implementation of a query interface for a generic record server.
PG  - 754-64
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2008.05.003 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This paper presents work to define a representation for clinical 
      research queries that can be used for the design of generic interfaces to 
      electronic healthcare record (EHR) systems. Given the increasing prevalence of 
      EHR systems, with the potential to accumulate life-long health records, 
      opportunities exist to analyse and mine these for new knowledge. This potential 
      is presently limited by many factors, one of which is the challenge of extracting 
      information from them in order to execute a research query. METHOD: There is 
      limited pre-existing work on the generic specification of clinical queries. Sets 
      of example queries were obtained from published studies and clinician reference 
      groups. These were re-represented as structured logical expressions, from which a 
      generalisable pattern (information model) was inferred. An iterative design and 
      implementation approach was then pursued to refine the model and evaluate it. 
      RESULTS: This paper presents a set of requirements for the generic representation 
      of clinical research queries, and an information model to represent any arbitrary 
      such query. A middleware component was implemented as an interface to an existing 
      system that holds 20,000 anonymised cancer EHRs in order to validate the model. 
      This component was interfaced in turn to a query design and results presentation 
      tool developed by the Open University, to permit end user demonstrations and 
      feedback as part of the evaluation. CONCLUSION: Although it is difficult to 
      separate cleanly the evaluation of a theoretical model from its implementation, 
      the empirical evaluation of the query-execution interface revealed that clinical 
      queries of the kinds studied could all be represented and executed successfully. 
      However, performance was a problem and this paper outlines some of the challenges 
      faced in building generic components to handle specialised data structures on a 
      large scale. The limitations of this work are also discussed. The work 
      complements many years of European research and standardisation on the 
      interoperable communication of electronic health records, by proposing a way in 
      which one or more EHR systems might be queried in a standardised way.

TI  - Information technology tools to improve treatment of patients with depression: 
      focus on guidelines implementation.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - Information technology has the potential to improve and support the treatment of 
      depression. Use of clinical guidelines can improve outcome of treatment, but 
      implementation of guidelines is a demanding process and the resulting user 
      compliance is often poor. Electronic health records, clinical decision support 
      systems and other information technology tools seem at first glance to be a 
      preferable way to implement clinical guidelines since they require user's active 
      and problem oriented participation. This article reviews attempts made so far at 
      use of information tools for implementation of clinical guidelines for depression 
      treatment and discusses their effects. It turns out that there are few existing 
      solutions, ambiguous effects and that usage is often limited. In future the 
      factors determining development of successful electronic tools for clinical 
      guidelines implementation will need to be further specified. Further research 
      projects are underway in Slovenia to investigate these issues.

TI  - Expectations for the next generation of electronic patient records in primary 
      care: a triangulated study.
PG  - 21-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although primary care physicians are satisfied users of electronic 
      patient records (EPRs) in Norway today, EPR systems may not have reached their 
      full potential. We studied primary care physicians' needs and experiences in 
      relation to EPRs and analysed potential improvements for today's EPR systems. 
      RESPONDENTS AND METHODS: This is a triangulated study that compares qualitative 
      and quantitative data from focus groups, observations of primary care encounters 
      and a questionnaire survey. RESULTS: General practioners (GPs) were not satisfied 
      with the level of availability of information within EPR systems. They were 
      especially concerned about follow-up for chronic disease and dealing with 
      patients with multiple conditions. Many expressed a desire for reminders and 
      easier access to clinical guidelines under normal working conditions, as well as 
      the possibility of consultations with specialists from their EPR systems. GPs 
      placed importance on the ability to communicate electronically with patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Progress toward a problem-oriented EPR system based on episodes of 
      care that includes decision support is necessary to satisfy the needs expressed 
      by GPs. Further research could solve the problem of integration of functionality 
      for consultation with specialists and integration with patient held records. 
      Results from this study could contribute to further development of the next 
      generation of EPRs in primary care, as well as inspire the application of EPRs in 
      other parts of the health sector.

TI  - Problem-oriented patient record model as a conceptual foundation for a 
      multi-professional electronic patient record.
PG  - 565-75
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2007.11.002 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is widely accepted that the development of electronic patient 
      records, or even of a common electronic patient record, is one possible way to 
      improve cooperation and data communication between nurses and physicians. Yet, 
      little has been done so far to develop a common conceptual model for both medical 
      and nursing patient records, which is a first challenge that should be met to set 
      up a common electronic patient record. In this paper, we describe a 
      problem-oriented conceptual model and we show how it may suit both nursing and 
      medical perspectives in a hospital setting. METHODS: We started from existing 
      nursing theory and from an initial model previously set up for primary care. In a 
      hospital pilot site, a multi-disciplinary team refined this model using one large 
      and complex clinical case (retrospective study) and nine ongoing cases 
      (prospective study). An internal validation was performed through hospital-wide 
      multi-professional interviews and through discussions around a graphical user 
      interface prototype. To assess the consistency of the model, a computer engineer 
      specified it. Finally, a Belgian expert working group performed an external 
      assessment of the model. RESULTS: As a basis for a common patient record we 
      propose a simple problem-oriented conceptual model with two levels of 
      meta-information. The model is mapped with current nursing theories and it 
      includes the following concepts: "health care element", "health approach", 
      "health agent", "contact", "subcontact" and "service". These concepts, their 
      interrelationships and some practical rules for using the model are illustrated 
      in this paper. Our results are compatible with ongoing standardization work at 
      the Belgian and European levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our conceptual model is potentially 
      a foundation for a multi-professional electronic patient record that is 
      problem-oriented and therefore patient-centred.

TI  - The work practice of medical secretaries and the implementation of electronic 
      health records in Denmark.
PG  - 104-11
LID - 10.1177/183335830503400403 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of electronic health records will entail substantial 
      organisational changes to the clinical and administrative staff in hospitals. 
      Hospital owners in Denmark have predicted that these changes will render up to 
      half of medical secretaries redundant. The present study however shows that 
      medical secretaries have a great variety of duties, and often act as the 
      organisational "glue" or connecting thread between other professional groups at 
      the hospital. The aim of this study is to obtain a detailed understanding of the 
      pluralism of work tasks the medical secretaries perform. It is concluded that 
      clinicians as well as nurses depend on medical secretaries, and therefore to 
      reduce the number of secretaries because electronic health record systems are 
      implemented needs very careful thinking, planning and discussion with the other 
      professions involved.

TI  - Use of electronic health record structured text and its payoffs. The approach and 
      barriers to using structured text in EHR to document care encounters.
PG  - 14-9
AB  - The Military Health System (MHS) deployed its electronic health record (EHR), 
      AHLTA to Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) around the world. This paper 
      focuses on the approach and barriers to using structured text in AHLTA to 
      document care encounters and illustrates the direct correlation between the use 
      of structured text and achievement of expected benefits. AHLTA uses commercially 
      available products, a health data dictionary and standardized medical 
      terminology, enabling the capture of structured computable data. With structured 
      text stored in the AHLTA Clinical Data Repository (CDR), the MHS has seen a 
      return on its EHR investment with improvements in the accuracy and completeness 
      of coding and the documentation of care provided. Determining the aspects of 
      documentation where structured text is most beneficial, as well as the degree of 
      structured text needed has been a significant challenge. This paper describes how 
      the economic value framework aligns the enterprise strategic objectives with the 
      EHR investment features, performance metrics and expected benefits. The framework 
      analyses focus on return on investment calculations, baseline assessment and 
      post-implementation benefits validation. Cost avoidance, revenue enhancements and 
      operational improvements, such as evidence-based medicine and medical 
      surveillance can be directly attributed to use structured text.

TI  - Reducing errors and risk in a prenatal network with an electronic medical record.
PG  - 987-93
AB  - In 2002 the Institute of Medicine called for implementation of information 
      technologies in health care settings to improve quality of care and reduce the 
      incidence of medical errors. Nowhere is this need more critical than in 
      obstetrics. In recent years numerous electronic prenatal medical records have 
      become available. To date there has been little literature to identify what 
      constitutes the important features in these systems, nor research into whether 
      these systems actually improve the quality of care or the outcome of pregnancies. 
      In this article we will elucidate some of the features that we feel are critical 
      if we are to achieve these goals. Some of these features are: (1) availability 
      across a computer network so that providers can access the record in a variety of 
      settings, (2) simplicity of the user interface to ensure provider compliance with 
      the system, (3) an intelligent system to encourage completeness of documentation 
      in the medical record, (4) a problem-oriented obstetric chart so that no issue is 
      overlooked and each is adequately addressed, and (5) administrative features to 
      allow evaluation to ensure improved quality of care. These features together, we 
      believe, will help to minimize medical errors, improve patient outcomes and 
      reduce liability exposure.

TI  - Effect of electronic patient record use on mortality in End Stage Renal Disease, 
      a model chronic disease: retrospective analysis of 9 years of prospectively 
      collected data.
PG  - 38
AB  - BACKGROUND: In chronic disease, health information technology promises but has 
      yet to demonstrate improved outcomes and decreased costs. The main aim of the 
      study was to determine the effects on mortality and cost of an electronic patient 
      record used in daily patient care in a model chronic disease, End Stage Renal 
      Disease, treated by chronic maintenance hemodialysis. Dialysis treatment is 
      highly regulated, and near uniform in treatment modalities and drugs used. 
      METHODS: The particular electronic patient record, patient-centered and 
      extensively coded, was used first in patient care in 3 dialysis units in New 
      York, NY in 1998, 1999, and 2000. All data were stored "live"; none were 
      archived. By December 31, 2006, the patients had been treated by maintenance 
      hemodialysis for a total of 3924 years. A retrospective analysis was made using 
      query tools embedded in the software. The United States Renal Data System 
      dialysis population served as controls. In all there were 1790 patients, with 
      many underlying primary diseases and multiple comorbid conditions affecting many 
      organ systems. Year by year mortality, hospital admissions, and staffing were 
      analyzed, and the data were compared with national data compiled by the United 
      States Renal Data System. RESULTS: Analyzed by calendar year after electronic 
      patient record implementation, mortality decreased strikingly. In years 3-9 
      mortality was lower than in years 1-2 by 23%, 48%, and 34% in the 3 units, and 
      was 37%, 37%, and 35% less than that reported by the United States Renal Data 
      System. Clinical staffing was 25% fewer per 100 patients than the national 
      average, thereby lowering costs. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first 
      demonstration that an electronic patient record, albeit of particular design, can 
      have a favorable effect on outcomes and cost in chronic disease. That the 
      population studied has many underlying diseases affecting all organ systems 
      suggests that the electronic patient record design may enable application to many 
      fields of medical practice.

TI  - The nodes focusing tool for clinical course data of hypergraph structure in the 
      ontological framework CSX output from POMR-based EMR system.
PG  - 741-5
AB  - Knowledge management is one of the significant issues in this century. In medical 
      informatics, the concept of ontology is an important current topic. In addition, 
      there is great interest in knowledge acquisition from clinical data. When doctors 
      use clinical information systems (CIS), their operation implicitly represents, to 
      some extent, their thinking processes with clear reasons and goals according to 
      their intent. If we can capture such resources in an appropriate representation, 
      considerable empirical knowledge could be utilized in various research fields. 
      With this prospect, the authors built an experimental CIS and a nodes-focusing 
      tool for abstracting a summary of the clinical course being examined. The 
      information model is based on a thinking process model, and data are represented 
      in the ontological framework CSX. Then we showed the knowledge-abstracting 
      procedures with this tool. Some domain experts and intern students showed great 
      interest. The authors thereby concluded that such an empirical knowledge 
      acquisition environment is useful for research, education, and so on.

TI  - "ProvenCareSM": a provider-driven pay-for-performance program for acute episodic 
      cardiac surgical care.
PG  - 613-21; discussion 621-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether an integrated delivery system could successfully 
      implement an evidence-based pay-for-performance program for coronary artery 
      bypass graft (CABG) surgery. METHODS: The program consisted of 3 components: (1) 
      establishing implementable best practices; (2) developing risk-based pricing; (3) 
      establishing a mechanism for patient engagement. Surgeons reviewed all class I 
      and IIa "2004 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 
      Guidelines for CABG Surgery" and translated them into 40 verifiable behaviors. 
      These were imbedded within a new ProvenCareSM program and "hardwired" within the 
      electronic health record system, including order sets, templates, and "time 
      outs". Concurrently preoperative, inpatient, and postoperative care within 90 
      days was packaged into a fixed price. A Patient Compact was developed to 
      highlight the importance of patient activation. All elective CABG patients 
      treated between February 2, 2006 and February 2, 2007 were included (ProvenCareSM 
      Group) and compared with 137 patients treated in 2005 (Conventional Care Group). 
      RESULTS: Initially, only 59% of patients received all 40 best practice 
      components. At 3 months, program compliance reached 100%, but fell transiently to 
      86% over the next 3 months. Reliability subsequently increased to 100% and was 
      sustained for the remainder of the study period. The overall trend in reliability 
      was significant at P=0.001. Thirty-day clinical outcomes showed improved trends 
      () but only the likelihood of discharge to home reached statistical significance. 
      Length of stay decreased by 16% and mean hospital charges fell 5.2%.(Table is 
      included in full-text article.) CONCLUSION: A provider-driven pay-for-performance 
      process for CABG, enabled by an electronic health record system, can reliably 
      deliver evidence-based care, fundamentally alter reimbursement incentives, and 
      may ultimately improve outcomes and reduce resource use.

PG  - 328-31
AB  - The structure of medical records becomes ever more critical with the advent of 
      electronic records. The Health Informatics Unit (HIU) of the Royal College of 
      Physicians has two work streams in this area. The Records Standards programme is 
      developing generic standards for all entries into medical notes and standards for 
      the content of admission, handover and discharge records. The Information 
      Laboratory (iLab) focuses on hospital episode statistics and their use for 
      monitoring clinician performance. Clinician endorsement of the work is achieved 
      through extensive consultations. Generic medical record-keeping standards are now 
      available.

TI  - Do general practitioners adhere to the guideline on infectious conjunctivitis? 
      Results of the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice.
PG  - 54
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1996 the guideline 'The Red Eye' was first published by the Dutch 
      College of General Practitioners. The extent to which general practitioners 
      adhere to this guideline is unclear. Recently, data on the management of 
      infectious conjunctivitis by general practitioners became available from the 
      Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. We measured the age-specific 
      incidence of infectious conjunctivitis, described its management by Dutch general 
      practitioners, and then compared these findings with the recommendations made in 
      the guideline. METHODS: In 2001, over a 12-month period, data from all patient 
      contacts with 195 general practitioners were taken from electronic medical 
      records. Registration was episode-oriented; all consultations dealing with the 
      same health problem were grouped into disease episodes. Data concerning all 
      episodes of infectious conjunctivitis (ICPC-code F70 and sub codes) were 
      analysed. RESULTS: Over one year, 5,213 new and recurrent episodes of infectious 
      conjunctivitis were presented to general practitioners from a population of N = 
      375,899, resulting in an overall incidence rate of 13.9 per 1000 person-years, 
      varying from more than 80/1000 py in children up to one-year old, to less than 
      12/1000 py in children over the age of 4. Topical ophthalmic ointments were 
      prescribed in 87% of the episodes, of which 80% was antibiotic treatment. Fusidic 
      acid gel was most frequently prescribed (69%). In most episodes general 
      practitioners did not adhere to the guideline. CONCLUSION: In 2001, the 
      management of infectious conjunctivitis by Dutch general practitioners was not in 
      accordance with the recommendations of the consensus-based guideline published 
      five years previously, despite its wide distribution. In 2006 this guideline was 
      revised. Its successful implementation requires more than distribution alone. 
      Probably the most effective way to achieve this is by following a model for 
      systemic implementation.

TI  - From a conceptual problem-oriented electronic patient record model to running 
      systems: a nationwide assessment.
PG  - 346-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of problem-oriented conceptual models for electronic 
      patient record (EPR) systems can improve data communication between health 
      professionals. But little has been done so far to investigate to what extent it 
      is possible to implement such models in operational EPR systems. OBJECTIVE: In 
      this paper, we measure the conformance between a conceptual model and the various 
      ways it is implemented within general practitioners' (GPs') electronic patient 
      records. METHODS: We started from a simple problem-oriented conceptual model and 
      we defined an original discriminating method to assess its implementation. This 
      method is scenario-based (dummy patient), functional, and relative (comparison 
      between software systems). Each implementation is assessed by two evaluators and 
      the final result is a "success/failure" score. The assessment was performed 
      within the scope of the official Belgian accreditation procedure for GPs' 
      electronic patient records, which is voluntary, publicly funded, and based on a 
      dynamic quality improvement paradigm. Almost all Belgian GPs' software systems 
      (17) were assessed. The robustness of our results was assessed through a 
      sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: We found that 65% (11/17) of the software systems 
      currently used succeeded in implementing the problem-oriented conceptual model 
      with a high confidence level (error rate<10%). The results were widely accepted 
      by the software developers. CONCLUSIONS: A problem-oriented conceptual model can 
      be successfully implemented in many operational EPR systems. The quality of the 
      implementation can be assessed. Our results could be used at the international 
      level to improve semantic interoperability between patient information systems, 
      for instance in relation to broader conceptual models such as the European 
      CONTsys pre-norm.

TI  - [Detailed data collection regarding the utilization of medical services, 
      morbidity, course of illness and outcomes by episode-based documentation in 
      general practices within the CONTENT project].
PG  - 284-91
AB  - Billing data for individual patients from General Practice surgeries can be used 
      to analyse primary care utilisation. Making these data available for research and 
      controlling purposes of the German health care system is vital for health 
      services research. Due to the predominant billing purposes, German routine data 
      are unlikely to yield a realistic and differentiated picture of primary care. The 
      General Practice morbidity research network CONTENT (CONTinuous morbidity 
      registration Epidemiologic NeTwork) was established as part of the primary care 
      research grant of the German Federal Ministry of Research and Education. As 
      opposed to other available German routine health care data, the project is 
      designed around episodes of care as the ordering principle of primary care. An 
      episode-based registration integrates the elements reason for encounter, result 
      of the encounter and medical procedure across the quarterly billing timeframe. 
      The use of the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) in the CONTENT 
      project supports a specific adaptation to documentation in primary care. As 
      opposed to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, 
      and Causes of Death (ICD), ICPC was especially developed for primary care 
      purposes. An episode-based registration and an appropriate classification are 
      prerequisites for a realistic and detailed picture of morbidity and services 
      provided in primary care. An existing electronic medical record (EMR) was 
      extended with domain-specific modules in order to meet the requirements of 
      episode-based registration. The resulting database has already yielded analyses 
      that were impossible to achieve from German routine health care data. Further 
      analyses will subsequently be based on the continuously expanding database and 
      have the potential to shed light on complex epidemiological and health economics 
      research questions. First results point in the direction that the new mode of 
      data collection, in contrast to routinely entered data, features the potential 
      for a more detailed assessment concerning utilisation of medical services, 
      morbidity, course of illness and outcomes in the context of primary care.

TI  - Data acquisition behaviors during inpatient results review: implications for 
      problem-oriented data displays.
PG  - 644-8
AB  - Problem-oriented electronic medical records may have significant advantages over 
      source-oriented organization of patient data. However, reorganizing data in this 
      fashion may have unexpected consequences for the clinical decision-making 
      process. To determine what these consequences might be, we conducted a pilot 
      study using verbal protocols and video screen capture to characterize physician 
      subjects' use of a traditional laboratory data display while reviewing unfamiliar 
      inpatient cases. We found that subjects navigated to the laboratory display 
      primarily to seek evidence confirming a result or problem identified elsewhere in 
      the case. Additionally, 22% of the time subjects spontaneously reviewed anomalous 
      findings and results related to other known problems. These results suggest that 
      physicians have learned complex data acquisition behaviors for efficient 
      interaction with source-oriented displays, and further study is needed to ensure 
      that problem-oriented medical records do not lose the benefits of these 
      behaviors.

TI  - On educating about medical data management - the other side of the electronic 
      health record.
PG  - 74-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To summarize background, challenges, objectives, and methods for the 
      usability of patient data, in particular with respect to their multiple use, and 
      to point out how to lecture medical data management. METHODS: Analyzing the 
      literature, providing an example based on Simpson's paradox and summarizing 
      research and education in the field of medical data management, respectively 
      health information management (in German: Medizinische Dokumentation). RESULTS: 
      For the multiple use of patient data, three main categories of use can be 
      identified: patient-oriented (or casuistic) analysis, patient-group reporting, 
      and analysis for clinical studies. A so-called documentation protocol, related to 
      study plans in clinical trials, supports the multiple use of data from the 
      electronic health record in order to obtain valid, interpretable results. 
      Lectures on medical data management may contain modules on introduction, basic 
      concepts of clinical data management and coding systems, important medical coding 
      systems (e.g. ICD, SNOMED, TNM, UMLS), typical medical documentation systems 
      (e.g. on patient records, clinical and epidemiological registers), utilization of 
      clinical data management systems, planning of medical coding systems and of 
      clinical data management systems, hospital information systems and the electronic 
      patient record, and on data management in clinical studies. CONCLUSION: 
      Usability, the ultimate goal of recording and managing patient data, requires, 
      besides technical considerations, in addition appropriate methodology on medical 
      data management, especially if data is intended to be used for multiple purposes, 
      e.g. for patient care and quality management and clinical research. Medical data 
      management should be taught in health and biomedical informatics programs.

TI  - The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2): an essential tool in 
      the EPR of the GP.
PG  - 809-14
AB  - The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) has become a standard all 
      over the world. It became a standard tool to classify the important elements in 
      the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) of the GP: reasons for encounter (RFE) 
      reflecting the patient's view, process of care (decision, action, intervention or 
      plans) reflecting the care process, and the assessment (diagnosis or health 
      issue) reflecting the doctor's view. ICPC-2 is fully compatible with structuring 
      data in the episode of care model and it's reflecting the essential elements of 
      each patient/provider encounter. To implement ICPC-2 in the EPR a Thesaurus has 
      been developed in Belgium with double encoded clinical labels. The implementation 
      is now mandatory for labeled EPR systems in Belgium. The use of ICPC 2 ay improve 
      the accessibility and use of on-line Expert systems and Guidelines.

TI  - Can temporary paper-based patient records sensibly complete an electronic patient 
      record?
PG  - 207-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the department of internal medicine of Heidelberg University 
      Hospital (HUH), medical patient records are archived electronically. Since there 
      are still paper-based external documents, a temporary patient record is 
      maintained for these documents during the patient's stay. Afterwards, the 
      paper-based documents are scanned, indexed and integrated in the electronic 
      patient record (EPR). To ensure process quality we evaluated quality and 
      availability of scanned documents in the EPR. METHODS: Observation study, 
      structured interviews, systematic quantitative before-after comparison. RESULTS: 
      The workflow takes place according to the guidelines of HUH. Nevertheless, there 
      are variations in the different wards which may influence the quality. Of 343 
      scanned documents about 90% showed no loss of information. Most of the documents 
      with loss of information were ECG-curves. Four documents (1.2%) could not be 
      found in the EPR. All documents were assigned to the correct patient and episode 
      of care. The mean time from patient discharge to availability of scanned 
      documents in the EPR system was 36 days. CONCLUSIONS: Due to external paper-based 
      documents, a complete EPR is currently not possible. A temporary paper-based 
      patient record in addition to the EPR is not an optimum procedure but feasible. 
      The quality of the scanned, indexed and integrated documents in the EPR is high 
      and the availability is sufficient.

TI  - Is it possible for nurses and doctors to form a useful clinical overview of an 
      EHR?
PG  - 314-9
AB  - After implementation of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) at the hospital in 
      Frederikshavn (Denmark) the doctors expressed that they had lost the overview of 
      the information in the medical record and that it takes appreciably longer time 
      to use the EHR. The future Electronic Health Records in Denmark will be 
      structured according to the Fundamentals of the Danish Basic EHR Model, the 
      "G-EPJ" Process Model. In addition, the model is interdisciplinary, problem 
      oriented and based on clinical continuity. 16 clinicians from the hospital of 
      Frederikshavn have joined in four focus-group interviews to clarify which 
      information is used to form a clinical overview. The interviews have been 
      analyzed methodically referring to Grounded Theory, and we have identified 8 
      factors which support the clinical overview, and besides that doctors and nurses 
      form the clinical overview in different ways. Systematic information retrieval 
      has been carried out to clarify how to optimize on-screen data presentation. 
      Doctors, nurses and systems developers have worked together during 6 workshops, 
      which has resulted in a set of screen images that support the nursing overview at 
      the change of shift and the medical overview at ward rounds, respectively. The 
      value of these screen images for the clinical overview has been tested in a real 
      work situation at Roskilde Hospital, Denmark, in December 2005. And results show 
      that the need for retrieving information from other documentation sources fell 
      markedly when using an EHR instead of the usual paper-based record.

TI  - A framework for information system usage in collaborative care.
PG  - 282-7
AB  - Clinical information systems (CIS) can affect the quality of patient care. In 
      this paper, we focus on CIS use in the collaborative treatment of chronic 
      diseases. We have developed a framework to determine which CIS functions have 
      general usefulness for improving patient outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the use 
      of clinical information systems within a collaborative care environment, 
      identifying CIS functions important in chronic disease care. We grouped the 
      functions into categories of access, best practices, and communication (ABC). 
      Three independent raters selected the most important collaborative care related 
      functions from the HL7 Electronic Health Record Systems functional model, and 
      mapped the HL7 functions against the ABC categories. We then built a model of CIS 
      use and tested it on data from a cohort of patients with chronic illnesses. 
      RESULTS: Of the 133 HL7 elements in the ABC model, 60 (45%) were ranked as 
      important for collaborative care by two reviewers. Agreement was moderate for 
      importance (kappa=.20) but high for ABC categorization (kappa=.67). In our data 
      tests, for the 1105 patients, access 4.4+/-6.5, best practices 0.8+/-1.6, and 
      communication 2.9+/-4.5. CIS functions were used per episode of care. We were 
      able to identify several key functions that may affect patient care. For example, 
      certain CIS functions related to best practices were associated with higher 
      clinician adherence to testing guidelines. DISCUSSION: This framework may be 
      useful to assess and compare CIS systems for collaborative care. Future 
      refinements of the model are discussed.

PG  - 1084
AB  - The expanding functionalities of EHR require valid, medical problem list. This 
      study describes the preliminary validation of an automated problem list. A total 
      of 5482 health problems were documented in the system for 1535 patients. 
      Sixty-six percent of all health problems were automated by the system through 
      available information on administrative databases and only 3.6% of those were 
      rejected by physicians. Further validation of the system's automated problem list 
      is being conducted.

TI  - 5-year evaluation of electronic medical record flag alerts for patients 
      warranting secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.
PG  - 682-8
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of flag alerts that were placed in 
      electronic medical records on patients' adherence with National Cholesterol 
      Education Program (NCEP) guidelines for secondary prevention of coronary heart 
      disease. A secondary objective was to identify the proportion of patients who 
      were prescribed lipid-lowering agents and assess the barriers of patients who did 
      not reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) goals 5.6 years after the 
      intervention. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospective medical record 
      intervention. SETTING: University-based primary care clinic. PATIENTS: 
      Eighty-nine adult patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. INTERVENTION: 
      For each patient identified as needing secondary prevention for coronary heart 
      disease according to NCEP guidelines, flags were inserted into the patient's 
      electronic medical record. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline patient data 
      were collected. After 5.6 years, we performed a retrospective analysis. At that 
      time, 72 patients were evaluated; 17 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-four percent 
      of patients (39 of 72 patients) had reached their LDL goal compared with 25% (16 
      of 64 patients for whom complete lipid panels had been obtained) at baseline 
      (p=0.001). The proportion of patients prescribed lipid-lowering agents rose from 
      16% at baseline to 75% at follow-up (p=0.0001). However, 33 patients (46%) were 
      above their LDL goal levels at follow-up. Reasons for failure to reach LDL goal 
      were as follows: drug dosage not titrated (10 patients [30%]), adverse drug 
      reaction (four patients [12%]), planned to adjust therapy in the future (three 
      patients [9%]), high drug cost (two patients [6%]), drug contraindicated (two 
      patients [6%]), and non-compliance (one patient [3%]). In 11 patients (33%), the 
      reason for failure was not addressed in the progress notes. Thus, inadequate drug 
      dosage titration (dosage not titrated, planned to adjust therapy, and reason not 
      addressed [assume no action]) occurred in more than 70% of these patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the need for regular evaluation of 
      patients' lipid panels followed by appropriate therapy titration to reach LDL 
      goals. Further study of factors influencing cholesterol management and methods to 
      improve adherence is needed.

TI  - A mathematical theory for identifying and measuring severity of episodes of care.
PG  - 72-82
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We propose and test a method for constructing episodes of care from 
      data within administrative databases and electronic health records. SUBJECTS: We 
      created a measure for severity of episodes of illness for 565 randomly chosen 
      developmentally delayed children who were enrolled in the Medicaid program. 
      DESIGN: Regression analysis was conducted to test the percentage of variance 
      explained by our proposed mathematical model in cost of care. DATA COLLECTION: 
      Data included both hospitalizations and clinic visits obtained from Medicaid 
      programs from one southeastern state. METHODS: For each patient, the likelihood 
      that two diagnoses are part of the same episode is proportional to the similarity 
      of the two diagnoses and to the short time interval between them. When this 
      likelihood exceeds a preset cutoff, then the two diagnoses are part of the same 
      episode. The cutoff is estimated by selecting number of days before two very 
      similar diagnoses are considered to be part of separate episodes. The similarity 
      between two diagnoses is assumed to be proportional to co-occurrence of the two 
      diagnoses within a fixed period (usually 30 days). The severity of an episode was 
      calculated using a Muliplicative Multiattribute Utility model, where severity of 
      each diagnosis is aggregated to estimate the overall severity of the episode. 
      Severity of each diagnosis was assumed to be proportional to average cost of a 
      diagnosis-if patients do not die before care is delivered. The article includes 
      an algorithm that can classify a patient's diagnosis into episodes of care and 
      measure severity of the episodes from date of diagnoses, code for the diagnoses, 
      and charges for the visit. To facilitate integration with existing database, the 
      article includes a Standard Query Language computer program. To evaluate the 
      method of constructing episodes of care, we regressed cost of care on the 
      patient's number of episodes of care within the year, average severity of the 
      episodes within the year, and the interaction between number and average severity 
      of the episodes. RESULTS: The number of episodes (alpha = .001), the average 
      severity of the episodes (alpha = .001), and the product of the two (alpha = 
      .001) had statistically significant relationships to the average cost of the 
      case. The 3 variables together explained 53% of variation in yearly cost of care. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that our proposed mathematical approach is 
      reasonable and produces severity scores that are predictive of objective criteria 
      such as cost of care.

TI  - The CONTENT project: a problem-oriented, episode-based electronic patient record 
      in primary care.
PG  - 249-55
AB  - In order to obtain a proper knowledge base in primary care, a form of electronic 
      patient record is needed that takes into account the specific characteristics of 
      the doctor-patient encounter, the patient population, the presentation of 
      diseases and the associated prevalences. However, in real life this has not 
      happened for several reasons. For the most part, existing patient records are 
      determined by invoicing requirements rather than by endeavours to meet the 
      intrinsic needs of primary care. CONTENT (CONTinuous morbidity registration 
      Epidemiologic NeTwork) is an ambitious scientific project in Germany to establish 
      a system for adequate record keeping and analysis in primary care. Based on a 
      classification system designed for the special situation of primary care, a 
      scientific network is being established consisting of participating surgeries, 
      general practitioners, computer scientists and statisticians. The project is 
      supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The aims are 
      strictly scientific and the underlying hypothesis is that the knowledge-gaining 
      process can be accelerated by combining the experience of many, especially with 
      respect to complex interactions of factors and the analysis of rare events. Aside 
      from maintaining a morbidity registry, within the CONTENT framework various 
      prospective and retrospective studies on particular epidemiological and health 
      economic research topics will be conducted.

TI  - Natural language processing to extract medical problems from electronic clinical 
      documents: performance evaluation.
PG  - 589-99
AB  - In this study, we evaluate the performance of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
      application designed to extract medical problems from narrative text clinical 
      documents. The documents come from a patient's electronic medical record and 
      medical problems are proposed for inclusion in the patient's electronic problem 
      list. This application has been developed to help maintain the problem list and 
      make it more accurate, complete, and up-to-date. The NLP part of this 
      system-analyzed in this study-uses the UMLS MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) application 
      and a negation detection algorithm called NegEx to extract 80 different medical 
      problems selected for their frequency of use in our institution. When using MMTx 
      with its default data set, we measured a recall of 0.74 and a precision of 0.756. 
      A custom data subset for MMTx was created, making it faster and significantly 
      improving the recall to 0.896 with a non-significant reduction in precision.

TI  - Continuity of care and cardiovascular risk factor management: does care by a 
      single clinician add to informational continuity provided by electronic medical 
      records?
PG  - 689-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records allow information sharing among multiple 
      clinicians treating the same patient, enabling informational continuity between 
      visits. OBJECTIVE: To assess the contribution of continuity of care (COC) with a 
      single clinician to short-term outcomes in a setting in which electronic medical 
      records are used. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Between 
      January 1, 2003, and October 1, 2004, we identified 3718 patients assessed for 
      lipid and blood pressure control and a subgroup of 1448 patients with diabetes 
      mellitus assessed for glycemic control in the primary care clinics of a large 
      Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility. Continuity of care was 
      defined as having been seen by the same clinician (physician or nurse 
      practitioner) in the year before testing. Analytic techniques accounting for 
      clustering of patients by providers yielded robust estimators for the association 
      between continuity with a single clinician and control of these cardiovascular 
      disease risk factors. RESULTS: Patients with complete COC were more likely to be 
      men with few medical problems and visits during the study period. Controlling for 
      these differences, we detected no association between COC and patient attainment 
      of recommended goals for cardiovascular disease risk factor control (P < .05 for 
      all). CONCLUSION: Continuity of care with a single clinician contributes little 
      to cardiovascular risk factor management in a setting in which electronic medical 
      records provide enhanced informational continuity, although its value may be 
      greater in the management and outcomes of established diseases that require 
      coordination of care and ongoing collaboration between clinician and patient.

TI  - Flexible information storage in MUDR(II) EHR.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - An important research task of the EuroMISE Centre is the applied research in the 
      field of electronic health record (EHR) design including electronic medical 
      guidelines and intelligent systems for data mining and decision support. The 
      research in this field was inspired by several European projects. We have 
      proposed a mathematical meta-description of a flexible information storage model 
      based on the experience gathered in cooperation in those projects. In this model, 
      we use two basic structures called a knowledge base and data files. We describe 
      those two structures using the graph theory concepts. Furthermore, we use logical 
      formulas to express conditions that should be valid. Additionally, we present a 
      description of a global system architecture of a 3-tier EHR application with 
      interfaces based on the latest technologies; predominately on Web Services, SOAP, 
      XML, HTTP, CORBA, etc. According to our experience and test results gained from 
      the MUDR EHR usage, we describe an open universal solution, which can be applied 
      as the EHR kernel of hospital information systems. To realize this approach in a 
      daily practice for health professionals we have started a co-operative project 
      with clinical information systems developers. Within that project we are 
      developing a new system for continual shared health care.

TI  - Towards a Generic Connection of EHR and DSS.
PG  - 211-6
AB  - Decision Support Systems (DSS) are typically integrated in Electronic Health 
      Record systems (EHR). By removing this integration full reuse of a DSS system is 
      possible. The connection between the EHR and the DSS system should be 
      standards-based and generic. We intend to demonstrate the viability of this setup 
      by implementing it using PropeRWeb as EHR system, Gaston as DSS system, HL7v3 
      messages and the SOAP protocol.

TI  - Disease and intolerability documentation in electronic patient records.
PG  - 1640-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Documentation of diseases and intolerabilities in electronic patient 
      records (EPRs) in pharmacies is needed to produce an alert in case a 
      contraindicated medicine is prescribed. Limited research is available concerning 
      EPRs in pharmacies. OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and quality of 
      documentation of diseases and intolerabilities in EPRs in a sample of Dutch 
      community pharmacies. METHODS: Each participating pharmacy (N = 79) collected 
      data on one day in May 2003 for each patient enrolled into the study (N = 687) 
      concerning demographics, drug use, and documentation of diseases and 
      intolerabilities. RESULTS: In 57.4% of the EPRs, at least one disease and, in 
      7.9%, at least one intolerability was documented. Higher age, number of drugs 
      used, and chronic disease score were associated with any documentation of a 
      disease/intolerability in the EPR. The highest sensitivity scores (completeness) 
      were found for diabetes (84.7%), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (strict definition: 75.9%), and hypothyroidism (75.0%). Rather low values were 
      found for prostatic hyperplasia (55.6%) and heart failure (29.4%). The positive 
      predictive value (reliability) was high for hypothyroidism (100%) and diabetes 
      (87.1%). CONCLUSIONS: In a selection of Dutch pharmacies, at least one documented 
      disease and/or intolerability was found in the EPR of almost 60% of the patients. 
      Certain diseases were documented to a relatively high degree; others had poorer 
      levels of documentation. For optimal surveillance of drug-disease interactions in 
      pharmacies, the frequency and quality of disease and intolerability documentation 
      need further improvement.

TI  - Automation of a problem list using natural language processing.
PG  - 30
AB  - BACKGROUND: The medical problem list is an important part of the electronic 
      medical record in development in our institution. To serve the functions it is 
      designed for, the problem list has to be as accurate and timely as possible. 
      However, the current problem list is usually incomplete and inaccurate, and is 
      often totally unused. To alleviate this issue, we are building an environment 
      where the problem list can be easily and effectively maintained. METHODS: For 
      this project, 80 medical problems were selected for their frequency of use in our 
      future clinical field of evaluation (cardiovascular). We have developed an 
      Automated Problem List system composed of two main components: a background and a 
      foreground application. The background application uses Natural Language 
      Processing (NLP) to harvest potential problem list entries from the list of 80 
      targeted problems detected in the multiple free-text electronic documents 
      available in our electronic medical record. These proposed medical problems drive 
      the foreground application designed for management of the problem list. Within 
      this application, the extracted problems are proposed to the physicians for 
      addition to the official problem list. RESULTS: The set of 80 targeted medical 
      problems selected for this project covered about 5% of all possible diagnoses 
      coded in ICD-9-CM in our study population (cardiovascular adult inpatients), but 
      about 64% of all instances of these coded diagnoses. The system contains 
      algorithms to detect first document sections, then sentences within these 
      sections, and finally potential problems within the sentences. The initial 
      evaluation of the section and sentence detection algorithms demonstrated a 
      sensitivity and positive predictive value of 100% when detecting sections, and a 
      sensitivity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 94% when detecting 
      sentences. CONCLUSION: The global aim of our project is to automate the process 
      of creating and maintaining a problem list for hospitalized patients and thereby 
      help to guarantee the timeliness, accuracy and completeness of this information.

TI  - Improved documentation of wound care with a structured encounter form in the 
      pediatric emergency department.
PG  - 253-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Accurate and complete documentation may enhance reimbursement and 
      compliance with financial intermediary regulations, protect against litigation, 
      and improve patient care. We measured the effect of introduction of a structured 
      encounter form on the completeness of documentation of pediatric wound management 
      in a teaching hospital. METHODS: The Children's Hospital Emergency Department 
      introduced a structured encounter form for use in the documentation of wound care 
      in place of the existing free-text dictation method. Attending physicians and 
      trainees, all unaware of the study, had the option of using the form in place of 
      free-text dictation for patients with lacerations requiring closure. We 
      abstracted 100 consecutive free-text dictations from patients treated before the 
      form's introduction. Following a 3-month run-in period, we abstracted 100 
      consecutive structured wound records. We compared the 2 chart types for 
      completeness of documentation based on 20 predetermined criteria relevant to 
      pediatric wound care. RESULTS: Overall completeness of documentation improved 
      with structured forms (80% vs 68% for free text, P < .001), with significant 
      improvements in 6 of 20 individual criteria. Trainees demonstrated improvement in 
      documentation with the structured form, with the greatest improvements among 
      senior-level residents. Documentation of the general physical examination 
      worsened with structured charting. DISCUSSION: In an academic pediatric emergency 
      department, the use of a structured complaint-specific form improved overall 
      completeness of wound-care documentation. Structured encounter forms may provide 
      for more standardized documentation for a variety of pediatric chief complaints, 
      thereby facilitating communication and ultimately transition to template-driven 
      systems in anticipation of an electronic medical record.

TI  - Universal electronic health record MUDR.
PG  - 190-201
AB  - One of the important research tasks of the European Centre for Medical 
      Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology - Cardio (EuroMISE Centre - Cardio) is 
      the applied research in the field of electronic health record design including 
      electronic medical guidelines and intelligent systems for data mining and 
      decision support. The research in the field of data storage and data acquisition 
      was inspired by several European projects and standards, mostly by the I4C and 
      TripleC projects. Based on experience gathered during cooperation in the TripleC 
      project we have proposed a description of a flexible information storage model. 
      The motivation for this effort was the large variability of the set of collected 
      features in different departments - including temporal variability. Therefore, a 
      dynamically extensible and modifiable structure of items is needed. In our model 
      we use two basic structures called the knowledge base and data files. The main 
      function of the knowledge base is to express the hierarchy of collectable 
      features - medical concepts, their characteristics and relations among them. The 
      data files structure is used to store the patient's data itself. These two 
      structures can be described using graph theory expressions. Based on this model, 
      a three-layer system architecture named "Multimedia Distributed Record" (MUDR) 
      has been proposed and implemented. During the implementation, modern technologies 
      such as Web Services, SOAP and XML were used. For the practical usage of EHR 
      MUDR, an intelligent application called MUDRc (MUDR Client) was created. It 
      enables physicians to use EHR MUDR in a flexible way. During the development 
      process, maximum emphasis was placed on user-friendliness and comfortable usage 
      of this application. Several methods of data entry can be used: pre-defined 
      forms, direct entry into the tree data structure of the EHR MUDR, or automatic 
      unstructured free-text report parsing and data retrieval. The system enables fast 
      and simple importing and exporting of data as well. The system integrates modern 
      multimedia formats (X-ray photos, sonography and other pictures, video-sequences, 
      audio records) as well as progressive methods of decision support systems 
      realized by medical guidelines and other modules.

TI  - Integrating electronic guidelines into the diagnostic cycle.
PG  - 156-65
AB  - Clinical guidelines have been used for diagnostic and treatment purposes, and 
      lately much of this information has become available in electronic formats. In 
      Norway a medical electronic handbook has been developed [1] to give support for 
      the physician, deciding upon diagnoses and treatment. This electronic handbook is 
      now widely used, but not in a systematic fashion - due to lack of 
      user-friendliness. The lack of integration with EPR systems and, more 
      importantly, the lack of integration with the working process, are additional 
      obstacles. In order to improve the usability of the electronic handbook, we have 
      developed a prototype where the commercially-available handbook is tightly 
      integrated with the EPR system and where the EPR system is based on a 
      problem-based approach. The prototype is focused on providing support to the 
      diagnostic process, treatment planning, documentation and pointers to extended 
      knowledge support. The integration of knowledge support and the EPR system was 
      based on a semantic model representation in the middleware and an XML-based 
      representation of the knowledge content within a SQL database. In addition to 
      clinical guidelines, the ICPC-2[2] codes and their inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria are used to support the diagnostic task.

TI  - Automated medical problem list generation: towards a patient timeline.
PG  - 587-91
AB  - The problem-oriented electronic medical record has been investigated as an 
      alternative to source-oriented organization of patient data. At the core of a 
      problem-oriented view is the medical problem list. Maintenance of the medical 
      problem list is often manual, making it highly user dependent. We detail the 
      beginnings of an automated medical problem list generator based on ICD-9: given a 
      set of ICD-9 codes associated with a patient record, the system maps the codes 
      (and related data) to an anatomy-centric hierarchy. 1 million patient encounters 
      from an outpatient setting were reviewed to generate a unique set of 7,890 ICD-9 
      codes. Natural language processing of the ICD-9 string descriptions identified 
      1,981 anatomical terms, which were subsequently mapped to one of 21 anatomical 
      categories. The output of the medical problem list generator was then used to 
      create a problem-oriented, gestalt view of a patient's medical record. 
      Preliminary evaluation of the generator revealed 100% recall, but only 60% 
      precision. This initial work has highlighted several issues in defining a medical 
      problem list, including questions of granularity and performance trade-offs.

TI  - A guideline management system.
PG  - 28-32
AB  - This paper describes the architecture of NewGuide, a guide-line management system 
      for handling the whole life cycle of a computerized clinical practice guideline. 
      NewGuide components are organized in a distributed architecture: an editor to 
      formalize guidelines, a repository to store them, an inference engine to 
      implement guidelines instances in a multi-user environment, and a reporting 
      system storing the guidelines logs in order to be able to completely trace any 
      individual physician guideline-based decision process. There is a system "central 
      level" that maintains official versions of the guidelines, and local Healthcare 
      Organizations may download and implement them according to their needs. The 
      architecture has been implemented using the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) 
      platform. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and a set of con-tracts are the 
      key factors for the integration of NewGuide with healthcare legacy systems. They 
      allow maintaining unchanged legacy user interfaces and connecting the system with 
      what-ever electronic patient record. The system functionality will be illustrated 
      in three different contexts: homecare-based pressure ulcer prevention, acute 
      ischemic stroke treatment and heart failure management by general practitioners.

TI  - Sick leave certification: an unwelcome administrative burden for the family 
      doctor? The role of sickness certification in Maltese family practice.
PG  - 50-5
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Malta, sickness certificates are needed from the first day of 
      illness, and are issued by family doctors (FDs) either employed in the government 
      primary healthcare system, or self-employed in private practice, or employed 
      directly by an employer for this purpose alone. Patients visiting self-employed 
      FDs pay directly, and are not reimbursed unless privately insured. We aimed to 
      contribute to the discussion on the impact of sickness certification in family 
      practice by studying the phenomenon using electronic data from an electronic 
      patient record (EPR) used by self-employed FDs. We used this data to study the 
      frequency of sickness certification and the relationship between the patient's 
      reason for encounter, with or without a formal request for a certificate, and the 
      doctor's diagnosis and certification practice. METHODS: We used data collected by 
      FDs in day-to-day private family practice using an episode-oriented EPR. The EPR 
      database included all encounters in all episodes of care over a period of one 
      year (1 January to 31 December 2001) documented by ten self-employed FDs, 
      comprehensively coded with ICPC-2-E (Electronic Version of the International 
      Classification of Primary Care, version 2). RESULTS: The EPR database documented 
      care for 7497 patients (45.4% male) over one year. During 15,781 encounters, 
      sickness certificates were issued in 11.3% of 16,319 episodes of care. 5.7% of 
      the reasons for encounter presented by the patient in new episodes were requests 
      for administrative procedures, and this request was made in 8.2% of all new 
      episodes of care. CONCLUSION: The distribution of morbidity seen by the FDs 
      appeared to be very wide, with a dominance of acute respiratory, gastrointestinal 
      and musculoskeletal symptoms and diagnoses, and the role of sickness 
      certification was quite important. The frequency of sick leave certification in 
      Malta is comparable with that in other European countries, but the average 
      duration of episodes is shorter. Just over 11% of private FD encounters involve 
      issuing a sickness certificate. The high proportion of reasons for encounter 
      formulated as a request for a sickness certificate suggests that the active role 
      of FDs in this form of social security in the Maltese population has supported 
      the local development of family practice.

TI  - Estimating incidence and prevalence of episodes of care in general practice.
PG  - 60-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop methods for prospective registration and analysis of 
      episodes of care (one or more contacts about the same health problem). To compare 
      estimates of point prevalence and incidence of hypertension among a group of 
      elderly patients by means of an elaborate coding of episodes and a new method 
      based on routine coding of contact diagnoses. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal 
      cohort study. SETTING: General practice in Denmark. SUBJECTS: 31 GPs and 1722 
      patients 70+ years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: During the course one year, 
      data were registered in the doctors' electronic medical record systems. 
      Registration included ICPC diagnoses and codes for diagnostic and therapeutic 
      procedures. Individual contacts were linked into episodes of care by the 
      recording physician. Prevalence and incidence were calculated from the GPs' 
      registration of episodes of care and from contact registration by means of a new 
      method, "the waiting time distribution". RESULTS: Estimates of incidence (2.1 per 
      100 patient years) and point prevalence (21.2 per 100 patients) of episodes of 
      hypertension care could be calculated when the GPs actively linked contacts into 
      episodes. Based on simple contact registration it was possible to calculate 
      similar estimates. CONCLUSION: A full registration of episodes of care is 
      time-consuming and complicated. Incidence and point prevalence of chronic 
      conditions, however, may be estimated from simple coding of contact diagnoses.

TI  - Excessive use of rapid tests in respiratory tract infections in Swedish primary 
      health care.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - A 1-y retrospective study of problem oriented electronic patient records, for 
      encounters concerning respiratory tract infection, was performed. The aim was to 
      analyse the management of respiratory tract infections in primary health care in 
      terms of diagnostic coding, tests and antibiotic treatment using data from 
      electronic patient records. 12 primary health care centres with a registered 
      population of 102,050 residents in 3 counties in southeast Sweden participated. 
      Data were retrieved electronically from records of patient encounters concerning 
      respiratory tract infections. The data were: patient age and gender, date of 
      contact, diagnostic code, CRP and GABHS tests and results, as well as antibiotic 
      prescriptions. In a total of 19,965 encounters, the most frequent diagnoses were 
      common cold (40%), acute tonsillitis (18%), and acute bronchitis (15%). A total 
      of 4445 GABHS tests (in 22% of encounters) and 6141 CRP tests (31%) were 
      performed, and both tests were done in 1910 encounters (10%). A total of 7934 
      antibiotic prescriptions were registered. The proportion of patients tested and 
      prescribed an antibiotic varied greatly between centres. We found an excessive, 
      and much varying, use of rapid tests in encounters for respiratory tract 
      infections. Data retrieval from electronic patient record systems was a feasible 
      method to study the use of laboratory tests in relation to pharmacological 
      treatment.

TI  - Assessment of a three-year experience with a Belgian Primary Care data Network.
PG  - 163-9
AB  - The paper describes the experiences with a Belgian Primary Care data Network from 
      1999 till 2002. Three cycles of data collection have been performed. The network 
      involves about 300 general practitioners (GPs) and up to 8 different software 
      packages. This network is semi-anonymous, semi-automatic and mixed (paper and 
      electronic with various software's). For the coming next years, efforts should be 
      focused on solving some frequently occurring problems with the data collection 
      through the EPR, such as a considerable number of data lacking and the fact that 
      GPs do not always use the problem oriented structure of the EPR (Electronic 
      Patient Record). Afterwards, more promising usage could be considered and 
      developed such as repeated data collection using a same GPs' sample, long-term 
      recording studies, usage of larger GPs' samples, etc.

TI  - A methodology for the functional comparison of coding schemes in primary care.
PG  - 145-8
AB  - There has been massive investment in the development of clinical terminologies 
      for use in electronic patient records. However, there has been little published 
      evidence for the added value for primary care that implementation of such a 
      terminology would offer. This paper outlines a methodology that has been used to 
      compare two existing coding schemes (Read codes 5 byte set and Clinical Terms 
      Version 3-CTV3) and demonstrates their relative performance using a 
      certainty-agreement diagram. In the study described, CTV3 offers improved 
      accuracy and consistency with improved usability. The potential advantages of the 
      recently released terminology, SNOMED Clinical Terms, are briefly considered in 
      this context.

TI  - How will practices cope with information for the new GMS contract? Coronary heart 
      disease data recording in five Scottish practices.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether practices will be ready for the data reporting 
      requirements for the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract, using coronary 
      heart disease (CHD) as an example. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. DATA SOURCES: 
      Electronic general practitioner (GP) records of all CHD patients in five Scottish 
      practices, validated by manual searches in 50 randomly selected patients in each 
      practice. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recording of family history, smoking status, 
      blood pressure (BP), diabetes testing, aspirin therapy and cholesterol 
      measurement. RESULTS: It is extremely easy for practices with completely 
      electronic patient records to extract a disease register (mean 10 min, range 38 
      sec to 3 hr 6 min). Extraction of a complete dataset takes several days if it 
      involves checking through paper records, whereas setting up and running a search 
      from electronic records is possible in less than two hours. If practices use the 
      same clinical system and identical data entry templates, the data can be directly 
      compared. Some items that are easily recorded as part of routine clinical 
      practice, such as prescribing of aspirin, are well recorded, but others, such as 
      BP recording, are more of a problem. One hundred percent of the CHD patients 
      sampled had a BP recording within the previous year, but some practices had these 
      data in the paper records where they were not readily accessible. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      have shown that in Scotland there is a high level of testing and recording of all 
      the important information regarding patients with recorded CHD, irrespective of 
      whether practices have fully electronic records, paper-based records, or a 
      mixture of the two. If practices have fully electronic patient records, the 
      information can be extracted easily, but unless there is a standard template, the 
      information can only be viewed in isolation and is of little value for 
      comparative purposes.

TI  - A conceptual model for documentation of clinical information in the EHR.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - At a national level in Denmark the development of a Conceptual Model for 
      Communication in Electronic Health Records (EHR) has moved towards a two-folded 
      structure, i.e. a conceptual model for documentation of clinical information, the 
      Clinical Process, and a Reference Information Model. The coupled structure 
      derived in the final phase of the development of the Conceptual Model for 
      Communication in EHR by the end of year 2001. This was inspired by the in-put and 
      collaboration of several parties in the Danish healthcare sector throughout the 
      period of development from 1999 to the current version 1.01 of the national 
      standard was launched by The National Board of Health in January 2002. The 
      modelling of the Clinical Process meets the need for a more clinical 
      understanding of how the use of information technology, i.e. EHR, can support the 
      work processes of shared-care and continuity of care in hospital settings. The 
      Clinical Process as a model for documentation in EHR facilitates the capturing of 
      clinical information where it emerges in the clinical work processes. The model 
      retains in a logical way the clinical relevant relations between different 
      information elements that comply with the concept of problem-oriented 
      documentation. A comparison between European Pre-standard CEN/ENV 13606 and the 
      Danish Conceptual Model reveals different approaches with regard to the focus of 
      modelling the EHR information.

TI  - Automated coded ambulatory problem lists: evaluation of a vocabulary and a data 
      entry tool.
PG  - 17-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Problem lists are fundamental to electronic medical records (EMRs). 
      However, obtaining an appropriate problem list dictionary is difficult, and 
      getting users to code their problems at the time of data entry can be 
      challenging. OBJECTIVE: To develop a problem list dictionary and search algorithm 
      for an EMR system and evaluate its use. METHODS: We developed a problem list 
      dictionary and lookup tool and implemented it in several EMR systems. A sample of 
      10,000 problem entries was reviewed from each system to assess overall coding 
      rates. We also performed a manual review of a subset of entries to determine the 
      appropriateness of coded entries, and to assess the reasons other entries were 
      left uncoded. RESULTS: The overall coding rate varied significantly between 
      different EMR implementations (63-79%). Coded entries were virtually always 
      appropriate (99%). The most frequent reasons for uncoded entries were due to user 
      interface failures (44-45%), insufficient dictionary coverage (20-32%), and 
      non-problem entries (10-12%). CONCLUSION: The problem list dictionary and search 
      algorithm has achieved a good coding rate, but the rate is dependent on the 
      specific user interface implementation. Problem coding is essential for providing 
      clinical decision support, and improving usability should result in better coding 
      rates.

TI  - A generic model of clinical practice.
PG  - 203-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many shared-care projects feel the need for electronic patient-record 
      (EPR) systems. In absence of practical experiences from paper record keeping, a 
      theoretical model is the only reference for the design of these systems. In this 
      article, we review existing models of individual clinical practice and integrate 
      their useful elements. We then present a generic model of clinical practice that 
      is applicable to both individual and collaborative clinical practice. METHODS: We 
      followed the principles of the conversation-for-action theory and the DEMO 
      method. According to these principles, information can only be generated by a 
      conversation between two actors. An actor is a role that can be played by one or 
      more human subjects, so the model does not distinguish between inter-individual 
      and intra-individual conversations. RESULTS: Clinical practice has been divided 
      into four actors: service provider, problem solver, coordinator, and worker. Each 
      actor represents a level of clinical responsibility. Any information in the 
      patient record is the result of a conversation between two of these actors. 
      Connecting different conversations to one another can create a process view with 
      meta-information about the rationale of clinical practice. Such process view can 
      be implemented as an extension to the EPR. CONCLUSIONS: The model has the 
      potential to cover all professional activities, but needs to be further 
      validated. The model can serve as a theoretical basis for the design of 
      EPR-systems for shared care, but a successful EPR-system needs more than just a 
      theoretical model.

      electronic patient record system.
PG  - 285-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality management in health care services has not been as successful 
      as in other industries. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential contribution of an 
      on-line incident reporting system (OIRS) and of an electronic patient record 
      (EPR) system to quality management in hospitals. METHODS: The two approaches are 
      being implemented in Osaka University Hospital. RESULTS: Analysis of the early 
      use of the on-line reporting system indicates that this qualitative approach has 
      been effective to avoid adverse medical events. The quantitative methodology with 
      the EPR is still in the phase of developing. CONCLUSION: Direct data entry by 
      medical staff and an EPR based on dynamic templates and a dynamic problem 
      oriented approach could be useful for building clinical data repositories that 
      can support clinical quality management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate textual content, health problems and diagnostic codes 
      in everyday electronic patient records. DESIGN: Retrospective and observational 
      database study. SETTING: Primary health care in Stockholm. SUBJECTS: Twenty 
      randomly selected general practitioners with 20 records each. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: The frequency of use of problem-oriented medical records. The number of 
      words, problems and diagnostic codes. The completeness and correctness of the 
      diagnostic codes. RESULTS: About 14.5% of 400 studied records were 
      problem-oriented. The mean number of words per record was 99.4, and the mean 
      number of problems managed per record was 1.2. On average, there were 1.1 
      diagnostic codes per record and this differed widely among GPs and also among the 
      electronic patient record systems. The mean number of codes per problem was 0.9, 
      and the proportion of correct codes was 97.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The electronic 
      patient records in general practice in Stockholm have an extensive textual 
      content. A vast majority of the problems are coded and the completeness and 
      correctness of diagnostic codes are high. It seems that problem-oriented 
      electronic patient record systems enforce coding activities. It is feasible to 
      establish a database of diagnostic data for research and health care planning 
      based on electronic patient records.

TI  - Developing an appropriate EPR system for the Greek primary care setting.
PG  - 239-46
AB  - The creation of an electronic patient record (EPR) system with a user-friendly 
      interface based on the concept of the episode of care was considered an urgent 
      priority in the present Greek context, where a Health Care Reform program is in 
      progress. This paper reports the procedures of developing an EPR system, and 
      outlines some of its essentials and key issues. We performed a systematic review 
      and analyzed the perceptions and patterns of use of existing EPR systems among 
      Greek general practitioners. On the basis of this analysis, Transhis was selected 
      using defined criteria for appropriateness, efficiency, and feasibility for 
      general practice as a prototype, for creating a Windows-based EPR system using 
      the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2) and International 
      Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as classifications. The new EPR system seems 
      appropriate for use within the current Greek primary care setting. Further 
      studies are required for its evaluation.

TI  - A context-sensitive methodology for automatic episode creation.
PG  - 707-11
AB  - Episode creation, the task of classifying medical events and related clinical 
      data to a high-level concept, such as a disease, illness or care, has been 
      primarily an interest of healthcare payers for purposes of cost outcomes 
      analysis. Traditional challenges in episode creation have included: 
      inconsistencies in defining episodes; lack of sufficient information to infer 
      episodes; and differences in methods for diagnosing and resolving episodes. 
      However, with the advent of the electronic medical record, which contains 
      multiple sources of patient-related information, data is now accessible to 
      construct more accurate and refined episodes. This work presents a 
      context-sensitive episode creation methodology that utilizes features extracted 
      from different medical repositories (e.g., claims records, structured medical 
      reports) to associate the data with their respective motivating episodes. The 
      combinatorial approach used to find the optimal clustering of patient-related 
      data into episode groups and the measure used to evaluate candidate episode sets 
      are described.

TI  - Using medication list--problem list mismatches as markers of potential error.
PG  - 106-10
AB  - The goal of this project was to specify and develop an algorithm that will check 
      for drug and problem list mismatches in an electronic medical record (EMR). The 
      algorithm is based on the premise that a patient's problem list and medication 
      list should agree, and a mismatch may indicate medication error. Successful 
      development of this algorithm could mean detection of some errors, such as 
      medication orders entered into a wrong patient record, or drug therapy omissions, 
      that are not otherwise detected via automated means. Additionally, mismatches may 
      identify opportunities to improve problem list integrity. To assess the concept's 
      feasibility, this study compared medications listed in a pharmacy information 
      system with findings in an online nursing adult admission assessment, serving as 
      a proxy for the problem list. Where drug and problem list mismatches were 
      discovered, examination of the patient record confirmed the mismatch, and 
      identified any potential causes. Evaluation of the algorithm in diabetes 
      treatment indicates that it successfully detects both potential medication error 
      and opportunities to improve problem list completeness. This algorithm, once 
      fully developed and deployed, could prove a valuable way to improve the patient 
      problem list, and could decrease the risk of medication error.

TI  - The index as a new concept towards an integrated framework for the electronic 
      patient record.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To overcome some classical limitations of the POMR (Problem-Oriented 
      Medical Record), including the management of divergent opinions between health 
      professionals, in order to construct a common patient record across multiple 
      disciplines in hospital settings and professional networks. METHODS: Using a 
      complex clinical case, we improved a POMR model previously used by GPs in order 
      to translate it into a hospital setting. The enhanced model has been assessed 
      through use in various ongoing clinical cases and through extended discussion 
      with professional end-users (physicians, nurses, general practitioners, and 
      social workers). RESULTS: The Index concept (flexible structural link) is 
      proposed as a major improvement in the construction of a POMR in a shared care 
      environment. CONCLUSIONS: The Index introduces interesting new perspectives. 
      Following its implementation in the Belgian pilot site in the CORINES project, 
      further studies remain to be carried out in order to develop a cost/benefit 
      assessment.

TI  - Restructuring the electronic medical record to incorporate full digital signature 
      capability.
PG  - 791-5
AB  - The security of Electronic Medical Records can be enhanced by the addition of 
      digital signatures that guarantee data integrity, authenticate the signer, and 
      establish non-repudiation through the use of public key encryption. The task is 
      complicated by the contribution of multiple providers to an encounter and the 
      entry of data at multiple points in time Dividing encounters into an episode of 
      care and redesigning the data model of the EMR will facilitate full signature 
      capabilities. Generation of digital signatures is best accomplished using 
      microprocessors on smart cards that control visibility of the private keys and 
      assist in user authentication. The Java Programming Language including 
      cryptography extensions and a smart card API is a useful tool for adding digital 
      signature to an EMR. Inter-operability of signatures and continuity of signature 
      will require attention to standards and preservation of cryptography and 
      authentication certificate archives. Digital signatures will need to accommodate 
      changes in data storage formats when information is transported between EMR 
      systems using XML or other transaction standards because the original signatures 
      will not validate if the data storage format changes. The costs of adding digital 
      signature to EMR mandates serious examination of the business case for digital 
      signature within an EMR as compared with transactions such as electronic 
      prescriptions. At present, there is no regulatory requirement for digital 
      signature of an EMR.

TI  - Dynamic viewer of medical events in electronic medical record.
PG  - 648-52
AB  - Medical record should enable doctors to comprehend the patient's history and 
      select suitable medical treatment. In paper based medical records, medical events 
      (examination, treatment etc.) are recorded successively, and problem oriented 
      recording is difficult to be applied to patients with much information and a long 
      history. Consequently it is not easy to understand the patient's history from 
      paper based medical records. In order to solve this problem, we developed the 
      flow sheet system in our electronic medical record (EMR). To make a flow sheet, 
      we analyzed the structure of the medical event data. In this paper we introduced 
      the medical event information model for our EMR. Furthermore, we clarified the 
      specification of the data presentation on the flow sheet. We developed the flow 
      sheet on the basis of these analyses. Because there are 3 layers in the vertical 
      axis of the flow sheet, many items of the medical event can be displayed on the 
      screen. When user clicks the cell, the corresponding detail data including images 
      are shown. This system functions to link medical event items with a problem, and 
      shows the bundled items on the flow sheet when the user selects the problem. We 
      implemented this system in Osaka University Hospital. The number of the types of 
      medical events and those of detail events in inpatients are 5.0+1.7 (mean+SD) and 
      60+47, respectively. The medical doctors in Osaka University Hospital evaluated 
      this system, and concludes that the flow sheet data presentation makes 
      comprehension of the patient's history easier than paper based records. As to the 
      function of bundling the items relevant to the problem, they feel it is 
      especially useful for patients with chronic disease. Thus the flow sheet data 
      presentation in EMR is useful for medical practice.

TI  - Ranking of information in the computerized problem-oriented patient record.
PG  - 594-8
AB  - We propose a framework for a problem-oriented patient record for general practice 
      1 and defend that the problem-oriented medical record represents an intuitive way 
      to organize the patient record. By adding a layer of knowledge to the electronic 
      patient record the record system is able to better utilize the information stored 
      in the record. If a record system is process aware, having knowledge of work 
      processes and is able to distinguish between different contexts in use, the 
      system can provide relevant and useful information during the handling of 
      patients' medical problems. Information is ranked according to its relevancy in a 
      given context by using action patterns - traces. Traces give valuable indications 
      of what is going on during the process of patient care. Decision frames 
      represents relevant contexts based on the information in the record. Both 
      decision frames and traces provide an environment in which more optimal medical 
      decisions can be made.

TI  - Advantages of long observation in episode-oriented electronic patient records in 
      family practice.
PG  - 229-35
AB  - From 1985-2000, 58 Dutch family physicians (FPs) of the Transition Project 
      collected ICPC-coded data on 47, 2451 episodes of care, first in paper records 
      for direct encounters only, later with a complete electronic patient record (EPR) 
      for all (direct and indirect) encounters. Based on these data, the effects of a 
      long observation period and the inclusion of all encounters (both direct and 
      indirect) in the EPR were studied. Long observation periods in EPRs appear to 
      have important advantages for patient documentation and the assessment of the 
      content of family practice. Comparison of data from a one-year versus a four-year 
      observation period showed a shift in utilization rates. In a long observation 
      period, visiting patients appeared to make less demand on care, while the content 
      of the FP's care for selected chronic diseases was reflected more realistically. 
      The inclusion of all indirect encounters in an EPR (as compared to the previous 
      inclusion of direct encounters only) resulted in more than twice the number of 
      coded entries per listed patient, and thus led to a major shift in perspective on 
      the FP's involvement in patient care.

TI  - Feedback on prescribing rate combined with problem-oriented pharmacotherapy 
      education as a model to improve prescribing behaviour among general 
      practitioners.
PG  - 843-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a working model with which prescribing behaviour among 
      general practitioners might be influenced. DESIGN: Intervention based on feedback 
      on prescribing rates and problem-oriented educational outreach visits, using 
      educational material and local opinion leaders. Randomised study with three 
      parallel intervention groups of general practitioners, which also served as 
      controls for each other. The pharmacotherapeutic fields chosen were hypertension, 
      peptic ulcer/dyspepsia and depression. Prescription data were retrieved from the 
      electronic patient records for periods of 1 year before and after the 
      intervention. SETTING: Six health care centres and three continuing medical 
      education groups in Stockholm. SUBJECTS: Forty general practitioners. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Drug prescribing rates and patterns before and after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: In the hypertension field, desired trends in fractional 
      prescribing (favouring diuretics and beta blocking agents) were recorded, with a 
      significant (P < 0.05) effect on prescriptions for agents acting on the 
      renin-angiotensin system, despite a pre-existing prescribing behaviour already 
      much in line with the goals. In the peptic ulcer/dyspepsia field, desired trends 
      were recorded for both types of therapies addressed. The fractional prescribing 
      rates for proton-pump inhibitors decreased from 61.0% to 52.6% in the 
      intervention arm and increased from 68.1% to 76.0% in the control arm (not 
      significant due to low power). The depression group focused on better general 
      attention to the disease and only minor changes were registered. CONCLUSION: 
      Feedback of individual prescribing rates, combined with problem-oriented 
      educational outreach visits, is a promising model for the improvement of 
      prescribing behaviour. Data from the electronic patient record were feasible for 
      feedback on prescribing rates.

AB  - The basics of a particular Integrated Electronic Health Record (I-EHR) 
      implementation are presented, as realised by the Patient Clinical Data Directory 
      (PCDD) system. PCDD operates within the context of HYGEIAnet, the Integrated 
      Healthcare Telematics Network of Crete. PCDD is based on a federation of 
      autonomous information systems and provides to its authorized users alternative 
      views of the health record as well as access and retrieval services to its 
      geographically distributed segments. The data model of the PCDD is based on the 
      Subjective Objective Assessment Plan (SOAP) model that originates from the 
      primary healthcare domain. Access to detailed information on particular patients 
      healthcare encounters is delivered via role-based authorization privileges and 
      controls. The administration of the national healthcare organizations' business 
      rules, for different user-groups, is made via a specially tailored and developed 
      rule-editor.

TI  - Consultation of medical narratives in the electronic medical record.
PG  - 289-93
AB  - This article presents an overview of a research project concerning the 
      consultation of medical narratives in the electronic medical record (EMR). It 
      describes an analysis of user needs, the design and implementation of a prototype 
      EMR system, and the evaluation of the ease of consultation of medical narratives 
      when using this system. In a questionnaire survey, 85 hospital physicians judged 
      the quality of their paper-based medical record with respect to data entry, 
      information retrieval and some other aspects. Participants were more positive 
      about the paper medical record than the literature suggests. They wished to 
      maintain the flexibility of data entry but indicated the need to improve the 
      retrieval of information. A prototype EMR system was developed to facilitate the 
      consultation of medical narratives. These parts were divided into labeled 
      segments that could be arranged source-oriented and problem-oriented. This system 
      was used to evaluate the ease of information retrieval of 24 internists and 12 
      residents at a teaching hospital when using free-text medical narratives divided 
      at different levels of detail. They solved, without time pressure, some 
      predefined problems concerning three voluminous, inpatient case records. The 
      participants were randomly allocated to a sequence that was balanced by patient 
      case and learning effect. The division of medical narratives affected speed, but 
      not completeness of information retrieval. Progress notes divided into 
      problem-related segments could be consulted 22% faster than when undivided. 
      Medical history and physical examination divided into segments at organ-system 
      level could be consulted 13% faster than when divided into separate questions and 
      observations. These differences were statistically significant. The fastest 
      divisions were also appreciated as the best combination of easy searching and 
      best insight in the patient case. The results of our evaluation study suggest a 
      trade-off between searching and reading: too much detailed segments will delay 
      the consultation of medical narratives. Validation of the results in daily 
      practice is recommended.

TI  - Education and training possibilities in Europe for chaining ambulatory and 
      hospital inpatients care.
PG  - 503-7
AB  - Although there is a trend to the development of the electronic patient record, 
      the need for uniform classification systems to document diagnoses and procedures 
      is still there. In the European Union, some research projects or concerted 
      actions promote the concept of episodes of care, meaning that the clinical status 
      of a patient might be followed by different health professionals in various 
      health care settings (ambulatory care, emergency, inpatient, long term care) 
      through medical record summaries. An inventory of teaching and training tools 
      related to information systems that classify diagnoses in various health care 
      settings has been made during the year 1998. Its results show that casemix tools 
      are mainly used for hospital inpatients, much less for outpatients and almost 
      never yet to link episodes of care. Computerised training tools exist in several 
      countries for coding as well as for grouping patients but this area appears still 
      too knew in the field of education because of a lack of European health policy to 
      use uniform data sets in order to measure the degree of efficiency as well as the 
      quality of health care delivery systems in the European union country members.

      Model.
PG  - 930-4
AB  - Modeling information for the electronic medical record (EMR) builds on a century 
      of study on information and its relationship to cost and quality improvement. An 
      initiative to examine the focus of cost and quality improvement and its 
      relationship to information modeling resulted in the development of the Unified 
      Service Action Model of healthcare processes, which focuses on the action as the 
      center of cost accounting, quality accounting and privacy management. The 
      application of this model to the HL7 Reference Information Model produced a 
      simplification of the HL7 model at the cost of increased reliance on vocabulary 
      terms for actions.

PG  - 310-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The computerized patient record must provide patient- and 
      problem-oriented access to all relevant patient data for health care 
      professionals. The aspects of such systems will be analyzed in the light of the 
      radiologist's needs. METHODS: Integration of the computerized patient record in a 
      hospital communication network allows automated data exchange with the ancillary 
      systems. Accessibility of electronic textbooks supports case-based learning 
      during routine work. RESULTS: The computerized patient record not only supports 
      routine clinical tasks but also training, education and research. The workflow in 
      a hospital can be supported by the computerized patient record. Studying the 
      tasks of a radiology department shows that both clinicians and radiologists will 
      benefit from such a system. DISCUSSION: Current implementations of clinical 
      computerized workstations offer only a fraction of these features. Advances in 
      technology and increasing demands at the point of care will promote the 
      development of new information systems of this kind.

TI  - Mental health problems in primary care: a research agenda.
PG  - 361-74
AB  - PURPOSE: The NAPCRG Task Force on Mental Health Problems was commissioned to 
      explore critical research and policy issues in mental health and to develop a 
      primary care research agenda for review and action by NAPCRG. This "White Paper" 
      presents the key findings and recommendations of the Task Force. METHODS: A 
      comprehensive review of the primary care mental health literature, using MEDLINE 
      searches with manual follow up, and personal communications with many active 
      researchers in the field were performed by the authors; Task Force members 
      participated in the editing and refinement of the White Paper in a series of 
      email and face-to-face meetings. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: Although primary care 
      researchers have made major contributions to our growing understanding of mental 
      health problems as they exist in the "real world" of primary care, rapid changes 
      in the U.S. health care environment threaten to undo the integration of mental 
      and physical health that is at the heart of primary care. It will be necessary 
      for the primary care leaders in this field to step forward to guide 
      policy-makers, purchasers, and the public as primary care is reengineered for the 
      next generation. Efforts to operationalize episode of care and comorbidity 
      recording with EMR systems, particularly in cooperation with managed care 
      corporations and/or primary care research networks, may represent the most 
      effective strategy for promoting the integration of mental health services into 
      primary care. The most promising area for research in the immediate future may be 
      descriptive studies that capture and explore the clinical epidemiology of common 
      mental health problems as they occur in routine practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The North American Primary Care Research Group (NAPCRG) Task Force on 
      Mental Health Problems was commissioned to explore critical research and policy 
      issues in mental health and to develop a primary care research agenda for review 
      and action by NAPCRG. This paper presents the key findings and recommendations of 
      the task force. METHODS: As co-chairpersons of the task force, we performed a 
      comprehensive review of the primary care mental health literature using MEDLINE 
      searches with manual follow-up and personal communications with many active 
      researchers in the field. Task force members participated in the editing and 
      refinement of this paper through electronic mail and a series of face-to-face 
      meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid changes in the US health care environment threaten 
      to undo the integration of mental and physical health that is at the heart of 
      primary care. It will be necessary for the primary care leaders in the mental 
      health field to step forward to guide policymakers, purchasers, and the public as

      research networks, may represent the most effective strategy for promoting the 
      integration of mental health services into primary care. The most promising area 
      for original research may be the exploration of common mental health problems in 
      the context of routine primary care practice.

TI  - The granularity of medical narratives and its effect on the speed and 
      completeness of information retrieval.
PG  - 571-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Using electronic rather than paper-based record systems improves 
      clinicians' information retrieval from patient narratives. However, few studies 
      address how data should be organized for this purpose. Information retrieval from 
      clinical narratives containing free text involves two steps: searching for a 
      labeled segment and reading its content. The authors hypothesized that physicians 
      can retrieve information better when clinical narratives are divided into many 
      small, labeled segments ("high granularity"). DESIGN: The study tested the 
      ability of 24 internists and 12 residents at a teaching hospital to retrieve 
      information from an electronic medical record--in terms of speed and 
      completeness--when using different granularities of clinical narratives. 
      Participants solved, without time pressure, predefined problems concerning three 
      voluminous, inpatient case records. To mitigate confounding factors, participants 
      were randomly allocated to a sequence that was balanced by patient case and 
      learning effect. RESULTS: Compared with retrieval from undivided notes, 
      information retrieval from problem-partitioned notes was 22 percent faster 
      (statistically significant), whereas retrieval from notes divided into organ 
      systems was only 11 percent faster (not statistically significant). Subdividing 
      segments beyond organ systems was 13 percent slower (statistically significant) 
      than not subdividing. Granularity of medical narratives affected the speed but 
      not the completeness of information retrieval. CONCLUSION: Dividing voluminous 
      free-text clinical narratives into labeled segments makes patient-related 
      information retrieval easier. However, too much subdivision slows retrieval. 
      Study results suggest that a coarser granularity is required for optimal 
      information retrieval than for structured data entry. Validation of these 
      conclusions in real-life clinical practice is recommended.

TI  - Diabetic ketoacidosis charges relative to medical charges of adult patients with 
      type I diabetes.
PG  - 349-54
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the medical charges for treating diabetic ketoacidosis 
      (DKA) episodes relative to direct medical care charges of adult patients with 
      type I diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an electronic 
      medical record system, we identified adult patients with type I diabetes who had 
      received inpatient or outpatient care on at least two occasions between 1 January 
      1993 and 30 June 1994. Resources and charges for hospitalizations, emergency room 
      visits, outpatient visits, and pharmaceuticals were recorded during this period. 
      One additional year of information was collected to assess the resources and 
      charges associated with multiple DKA episodes. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients 
      were identified, of whom 72 (36.0%) experienced a total of 161 DKA episodes. The 
      direct medical care charges associated with DKA episodes represented 28.1% of the 
      direct medical care charges for the cohort of patients with type I diabetes. The 
      average charge per DKA episode was $6,444. The estimated annual medical care 
      charge for each patient was $7,855 ($13,096 per patient experiencing a DKA 
      episode versus $4,907 per patient not experiencing an episode). Multiple DKA 
      episodes were experienced by 24 (12.0%) of the study patients and accounted for 
      55.6% of the direct medical care charges for these patients. CONCLUSIONS: DKA 
      episodes represented more than $1 of every $4 spent on direct medical care for 
      adult patients with type I diabetes and $1 of every $2 in those patients 
      experiencing multiple episodes. Interventions that are capable of even a modest 
      reduction in the number of DKA episodes could produce substantial cost savings in 
      a health care system and could be particularly cost-effective in adult patients 
      with recurrent DKA.

TI  - Clinical care management and workflow by episodes.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - This paper describes the implementation of clinically defined episodes of care 
      and the introduction of an episode-based summary list of patient problems across 
      Mayo Clinic Rochester in 1996 and 1997. Although Mayo's traditional paper-based 
      system has always relied on a type of 'episode of care' (called the 
      "registration") for patient and history management, a new, more clinically 
      relevant definition of episode of care was put into practice in November 1996. 
      This was done to improve care management and operational processes and to provide 
      a basic construct for the electronic medical record. Also since November 1996, a 
      computer-generated summary list of patient problems, the "Master Sheet Summary 
      Report," organized by episode, has been placed in all patient histories. In the 
      third quarter of 1997, the ability to view the episode-based problem summary 
      online was made available to the 3000+ EMR-capable workstations deployed across 
      the Mayo Rochester campus. In addition, the clinically oriented problem 
      summarization process produces an improved basic "package" of clinical 
      information expected to lead to improved analytic decision support, outcomes 
      analysis and epidemiological research.

TI  - How to approach the structuring of the medical record? Towards a model for 
      flexible access to free text medical data.
PG  - 27-34
AB  - The development and dissemination of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) is impeded 
      because of several reasons. One of the reasons is considered the 'unruliness' of 
      narrative data. In this article it is illustrated how the medical record can be 
      structured to make it accessible from different perspectives, without the need to 
      change the free text format of the narratives. The organising principles behind 
      three existing medical record structures are analysed: the source-oriented, 
      problem-oriented and time-oriented medical record. These principles are combined 
      in a model of the medical record with four different views on medical data: a 
      typological view, a time view, a problem view, and a process view. A data model 
      is presented in which each of these views can be defined. In the discussion some 
      examples are given of EMRs in which some of these views have been applied on 
      coded data.

AB  - This paper considers the lessons learnt during the development of the electronic 
      medical record for patient care. It is not a definitive history of medical 
      records but an assessment of what has been learnt, what has to be learnt and how 
      we can move forward. It considers the needs for structured intelligent records 
      that help in individual patient care, the need to provide functionality that fits 
      with the requirements of the clinician-patient interaction and the need to take 
      into account the human factors that affect clinician's uptake of such systems. It 
      outlines the issues of free form input as opposed to controlled input that have 
      to be resolved.

TI  - The concept of "template" assisted electronic medical record.
PG  - 249-52
AB  - A new design for an electronic medical record with flexible template generation 
      was developed. The "template" in this paper refers to one of the tools that calls 
      a user's attention to entering the data items for each problem or to ordering 
      tests when they are due. The template shows the patient's previous data and 
      guides physicians to record the consistent description. Two kinds of medical data 
      dictionaries are prepared. Data representations of signs, symptoms, laboratory 
      tests, and other examinations are defined in the check items dictionary. The 
      problem dictionary contains the possible patient problems with relation to check 
      items and other kinds of related subjects. This system provides Problem Oriented 
      Medical Record (POMR) and the graphical presentation of various patient data. The 
      system was designed to establish a constant and integrated medical record.

TI  - A simple approach to physician entry of patient problem list.
PG  - 206-10
AB  - The patient's problem list is one of the key components of the electronic medical 
      record. Besides the immediate benefits of using the patient problem list for 
      medical records coding and creation of discharge documentation, a coded problem 
      list is a prerequisite of patient management, clinical decision support and 
      research. The ICD9 coding system that is the current standard for coding 
      diagnoses and procedures is not conducive to physician usage. In this paper we 
      describe a simple system that provides physicians with a quick and easy method to 
      enter and maintain a patient's problem list. Physicians can use their own 
      terminology. ICD9 codes are included where possible, but free text is allowed. 
      The system strikes a balance between capturing a fully coded patient problem list 
      and encouraging usage by a wide physician user group.

      of Neuchâtel. The application includes a problem oriented electronic medical 
      record, software assistance for diagnoses coding, diagnostic and therapeutic 
      files, access to Medline, specific applications for intensive care and 
      neonatology, and also a medical server meant for exchanging data with general 
      practitioners and other hospitals. The reliability, the security and the 
      usefulness of the application are discussed, as well as the orientation of the 
      new application, being developed at present, is described. The physicians, i.e. 
      today users, must prepare themselves the applications for the coming years. The 
      treatment of the medical data must be optimal and also make the personal 
      relationship between the physician and his patient easier.

TI  - Foundations for an electronic medical record.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - Given the many efforts currently under way to develop standards for electronic 
      medical records, it is important to step back and reexamine the fundamental 
      principles which should underlie a model of the electronic medical record. This 
      paper presents an analysis based on the experience in developing the PEN & PAD 
      prototype clinical workstation. The fundamental contention is that the 
      requirements for a medical record must be grounded in its use for patient care. 
      The basic requirement is that it be a faithful record of what clinicians have 
      heard, seen, thought, and done. The other requirements for a medical record, 
      e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view. We 
      use the criteria developed to re-examine Weed's Problem Oriented Medical Record 
      and also relate the criteria to secondary uses of the medical record for 
      population data, communications and decision support.
