TI  - Frameless robot-assisted stereotactic biopsy: an effective and minimally invasive 
      technique for pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas.
LID - 10.1007/s11060-022-04122-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are prone to high surgical 
      risks, and they could even lead to death due to their specific sites. To 
      determine the value of frameless robot-assisted stereotactic biopsies of DIPGs, 
      when compared it with microsurgical biopsies. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective study of 71 pediatric patients who underwent biopsies from January 
      2016 to January 2021. (i) group 1: microsurgical biopsies, and (ii) group 2: 
      frameless robot-assisted stereotactic biopsies. Demographic information, 
      neuroimaging characteristics, pathological diagnoses, operation time, 
      postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) stay time, postoperative hospitalization 
      time, complications, cost, and perioperative mortality rate (POMR) were collected 
      for analyses. RESULTS: 32 Cases underwent microsurgical biopsies (group 1) and 39 
      cases underwent frameless robot-assisted stereotactic biopsies (group 2). All 
      cases were accurately diagnosed after surgery. There was no significant 
      difference in gender, age, symptom times and tumor volumes between the two groups 
      (p > 0.05); operation time, postoperative ICU, stay time and postoperative 
      hospitalization time were longer in group 1 than in group 2 (p < 0.001); the 
      intraoperative bleeding volumes and cost were higher in group 1 than in group 2 
      (p < 0.001). Group 1 patients required more perioperative blood transfusion than 
      group 2 (p = 0.001), and the new neurological impairments were more frequent in 
      group 1 than in group 2 (p = 0.003). The POMR was 9.38% (3/32) in group 1 and 0 
      in group 2 (p = 0.087). CONCLUSIONS: Frameless robot-assisted stereotactic biopsy 
      was an effective and minimally invasive technique for pediatric DIPGs.

TI  - Perioperative mortality among surgical patients in a low-resource setting: A 
      multi-center study at District hospitals in Southeast Nigeria.
PG  - 1004-1013
LID - 10.4103/njcp.njcp_1291_21 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The perioperative mortality rate (POMR) has been recognized as a 
      useful indicator to measure surgical safety at an institutional or national 
      level. The POMR can thus be used as a tool to identify procedures that carry the 
      highest mortality rates and provide hindsight based on past surgical experiences. 
      AIM: To document the pattern of perioperative mortality and the factors that 
      influence it at district hospitals in southeast Nigeria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      This was a retrospective study of cases of perioperative mortality at district 
      hospitals in southeast Nigeria between January 2014 to December 2018. All 
      perioperative mortalities from surgical admissions in both elective and emergency 
      set-ups were included. During analysis, we computed P values for categorical 
      variables using Chi-square and Fisher's exact test in accordance with the size of 
      the dataset. Furthermore, we determined the association between some selected 
      clinical variables and mortality using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: 
      During the period under review, 254 perioperative deaths occurred from 2,369 
      surgical operations, giving a POMR of 10.7%. Of the 254 deaths, there were 180 
      (70.9%) males and 74 (29.1%) females. Nearly one-third (31.2%) were farmers and 
      64.2% of the deaths occurred in those 50 years and below. Delayed presentation 
      was two-pronged: delay before presentation and in-hospital delay. The POMR was 
      the highest among general surgery emergencies and least among those with plastic 
      surgery conditions. The observed factors associated with mortality were time of 
      presentation (early or late), type of surgery (emergency or elective), category 
      of surgery (general surgery or others), American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      (ASA) score (high or low), place of admission after surgery (intensive care unit 
      or general ward), level of training of doctors who performed the surgery 
      (specialist or general duty doctor) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The POMR was higher 
      in male patients and in those with general surgery emergencies compared to other 
      conditions. Delayed presentation, high ASA scores, and operations performed under 
      emergency set-ups were associated with elevated POMRs.

TI  - Gastrectomy mortality in Australia.
LID - 10.1111/ans.17540 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in medical management and endoscopic therapy, 
      gastrectomy remains an important yet high-risk procedure for a range of benign 
      and malignant upper gastrointestinal pathologies. No study has previously 
      analysed Australian gastrectomy perioperative mortality rate (POMR). This 
      retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted to determine the 
      Australian national gastrectomy POMR, allowing state-based and regional trends 
      and outcomes to be assessed. METHODS: Logistic regression models were compared 
      using de-identified procedural data between 1 July 2005 and 30 June 2017 from the 
      Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Codes relating to total and subtotal 
      gastrectomy contained in the Australian Classification of Health Interventions 
      were used to extract patient data. Mortality rates were risk adjusted for age and 
      gender. Temporal trends and differences between states/territories and regions 
      were investigated. RESULTS: The national average POMR throughout the study period 
      was 2.1%. For subtotal gastrectomy, the national mean POMR was 1.1%, decreasing 
      from 2.7% (2005) to 1.3% (2017). For total gastrectomy, the national mean POMR 
      was 2.8%, decreasing from 3.3% (2005) to 1.7% (2017). POMR significantly reduced 
      over time without variation between states or regions. Procedure volume steadily 
      reduced in rural centres with a concomitant increase in metropolitan centres over 
      time. CONCLUSION: Pleasingly, the Australian gastrectomy POMR is favourable when 
      compared to international cohorts. Improved outcomes were consistent between 
      states and territories, and metropolitan and regional centres. Progressive 
      metropolitan centralization of gastrectomy was demonstrated without evidence of 
      improved outcomes.

TI  - Reducing surgical site infections and mortality among obstetric surgical patients 
      in Tanzania: a pre-evaluation and postevaluation of a multicomponent safe surgery 
      intervention.
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2021-006788 [doi]
LID - e006788
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite ongoing maternal health interventions, maternal deaths in 
      Tanzania remain high. One of the main causes of maternal mortality includes 
      postoperative infections. Surgical site infection (SSI) rates are higher in 
      low/middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Tanzania, compared with high-income 
      countries. We evaluated the impact of a multicomponent safe surgery intervention 
      in Tanzania, hypothesising it would (1) increase adherence to safety practices, 
      such as the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC), (2) reduce SSI rates following 
      caesarean section (CS) and (3) reduce CS-related perioperative mortality rates 
      (POMRs). METHODS: We conducted a pre-cross-sectional/post-cross-sectional study 
      design to evaluate WHO SSC utilisation, SSI rates and CS-related POMR before and 
      18 months after implementation. Our interventions included training of 
      inter-professional surgical teams, promoting use of the WHO SSC and introducing 
      an infection prevention (IP) bundle for all CS patients. We assessed use of WHO 
      SSC and SSI rates through random sampling of 279 individual CS patient files. We 
      reviewed registers and ward round reports to obtain the number of CS performed 
      and CS-related deaths. We compared proportions of individuals with a 
      characteristic of interest during pre-implementation and post implementation 
      using the two-proportion z-test at p≤0.05 using STATA V.15. RESULTS: The SSC 
      utilisation rate for CS increased from 3.7% (5 out of 136) to 95.1% (136 out of 
      143) with p<0.001. Likewise, the proportion of women with SSI after CS reduced 
      from 14% during baseline to 1% (p=0.002). The change in SSI rate after the 
      implementation of the safe surgery interventions is statistically significant 
      (p<0.001). The CS-related POMR decreased by 38.5% (p=0.6) after the 
      implementation of safe surgery interventions. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that 
      our intervention led to improved utilisation of the WHO SSC, reduced SSIs and a 
      drop in CS-related POMR. We recommend replication of the interventions in other 
      LMICs.

TI  - Improving Surgical Research Capacity in Low and Middle Income Countries: Can 
      Episodic Data Collection Reliably Estimate Perioperative Mortality?
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005105 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to empirically determine the optimal sample 
      size needed to reliably estimate perioperative mortality (POMR) in different 
      contexts. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: POMR is a key metric for measuring the quality 
      and safety of surgical systems and will need to be tracked as surgical care is 
      scaled up globally. Continuous collection of outcomes for all surgical cases is 
      not the standard in high-income countries and may not be necessary in low- and 
      middle-income countries. METHODS: We created simulated datasets to determine the 
      sampling frame needed to reach a given precision. We validated our findings using 
      data collected at Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. We used 
      these data to create a tool that can be used to determine the optimal sampling 
      frame for a population based on POMR rate and target POMR improvement goal. 
      RESULTS: Precision improved as the sampling frame increased. However, as POMR 
      increased, lower sampling percentages were needed to achieve a given precision. A 
      total of 357 eligible cases were identified in the Mulago database with an 
      overall POMR rate of 14%. Precision of ±10% was achieved with 34% sampling, and 
      precision of ±25% was obtained at 9% sampling. Using simulated datasets, a tool 
      was created to determine the minimum sample percentage needed to detect a given 
      mortality improvement goal. CONCLUSIONS: Reliably tracking POMR does not require 
      continuous data collection. Data driven sampling strategies can be used to 
      decrease the burden of data collection to track POMR in resource-constrained 
      settings.

TI  - Prophylactic Onlay Mesh Repair (POMR) Versus Primary Suture Repair (PSR) for 
      Prevention of Incisional Hernia (IH) After Abdominal Wall Surgery: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 3080-3091
LID - 10.1007/s00268-021-06238-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With many different operative techniques in use to reduce the 
      incidence of incisional hernias (IH) following a midline laparotomy, there is no 
      consensus among the clinicians on the efficacy and safety of any particular 
      repair technique. This meta-analysis compares the prophylactic onlay mesh repair 
      (POMR) and primary suture repair (PSR) for the incidence of IH. METHODS: A 
      meta-analysis and systematic review of MEDLINE, PubMed Central (via PubMed), 
      Embase (via Ovid), SCOPUS, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, SCI and Cochrane 
      Library databases were undertaken. Seven randomized controlled trials assessing 
      the outcomes of PSR and POMR were analyzed in accordance with the PRISMA 
      statement. The risk of bias was assessed using the Rob2 tool. RESULTS: According 
      to the pooled analysis, POMR significantly reduced the incidence of IH compared 
      to the PSR (OR 5.82 [95% CI 2.69, 12.58] P < 0.01) with a significantly higher 
      seroma formation rate post-surgery (OR 0.35 [95% CI 0.18, 0.67] P < 0.01). 
      Furthermore, the length of hospital stay (WMD -0.78 [95% CI -1.58, 0.02] 
      P = 0.05) was significantly shorter for PSR compared to POMR group. Comparable 
      effects were noted for reintervention, postoperative ileus, postoperative 
      hematoma, postoperative mortality, long-term intervention and long-term deaths 
      between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: POMR significantly reduces the risk of IH 
      when compared to the PSR, with an increased risk of postoperative seroma 
      formation and longer hospital stay. However, more RCTs with standardized 
      protocols are needed for meaningful comparisons of the two interventions, along 
      with longer duration of follow-up to assess the impact on the occurrence of IH.

LID - 256
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancers are aggressive cancers, most clinical studies 
      focused on the prognosis of patients with head and neck cancer. However, 
      perioperative mortality was rarely mentioned. METHODS: A retrospective analysis 
      was performed using all head and neck cancer patients admitting in the Department 
      of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South 
      University from January 2010 to December 2019. The analysis of overall survival 
      and progression-free survival were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and 
      cross tabulation with chi-squared testing was applied to analyze the difference 
      in parameters between groups. RESULTS: From January 2010 to December 2019, a 
      total of 6576 patients with head and neck cancers were admitted to our department 
      and 7 died in the hospital, all of whom were middle-aged and elderly patients 
      including 6 males and 1 female. The perioperative mortality rate (POMR) was about 
      1‰. The causes of death included acute heart failure, rupture of large blood 
      vessels in the neck, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy due to asphyxia, respiratory 
      failure and cardiopulmonary arrest. CONCLUSION: Preoperative radiotherapy, 
      previous chemotherapy, hypertension, diabetes, advanced clinical stage and 
      postoperative infection are risk factors for perioperative mortality of head and 
      neck cancer.

TI  - Prevalence of high-risk bladder categorization with prenatal and postnatal 
      myelomeningocele repair types.
PG  - 829-839
LID - 10.1002/nau.24629 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urologic substudies of prenatal myelomeningocele (MMC) closure have 
      focused primarily on continence without significant clinical benefit. Fetoscopic 
      MMC repair (FMR) is a newer form of prenatal intervention and touts added 
      benefits to the mother, but urological outcomes have yet to be analyzed. We set 
      out to focus on bladder safety rather than continence and examined bladder 
      outcomes with different prenatal MMC repairs (FMR and prenatal open [POMR]) and 
      compared bladder-risk-categorization to traditional postnatal repair (PSTNR). 
      METHODS: An IRB-approved retrospective analysis of all patients undergoing all 
      forms of MMC repairs with inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the MOMS 
      trial was performed. Bladder safety assessment required initial urodynamic 
      studies (UDS), renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS), and/or voiding cystourethrogram 
      (VCUG) within the 1st year of life. Follow-up analyses within the cohorts 
      required follow-up studies within 18 months after initial evaluations. Outcomes 
      assessed included bladder-risk-categorization based on the CDC UMPIRE study 
      (high, intermediate, and safe), hydronephrosis (HN), and vesicoureteral reflux 
      (VUR). A single reader evaluated each UDS. RESULTS: Initial UDS in 93 patients 
      showed that the prevalence of high-risk bladders were 35% FMR versus 36% PSTNR 
      and 60% POMR. Follow-up UDS showed only 8% of FMR were high-risk compared to 35% 
      POMR and 36% PSTNR. Change from initial to follow-up bladder-risk-category did 
      not reach significance (p = .0659); however, 10% PSTNR worsened to high-risk on 
      follow-up, compared to none in either prenatal group. Subanalysis of follow-up 
      UDS between the prenatal cohorts also was not significant (p = .055). Only 8% of 
      FMR worsened or stayed high-risk compared to 35% with POMR (p = .1). HN was 
      significantly different at initial and subsequent follow up between the groups 
      with the least in the FMR group. CONCLUSIONS: Early outcome UDS analyses 
      demonstrated lower incidence of high-risk bladders in FMR patients with a trend 
      toward clinically significant improvement compared to POMR in regard to all 
      evaluated metrics. Larger, prospective, confirmatory studies are needed to 
      further evaluate the potential benefits on FMR on bladder safety and health.

TI  - Assessment of Surgical Care Provided in National Health Services Hospitals in 
      Mozambique: The Importance of Subnational Metrics in Global Surgery.
PG  - 1306-1315
LID - 10.1007/s00268-020-05925-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surgery plays a critical role in sustainable healthcare systems. 
      Validated metrics exist to guide implementation of surgical services, but 
      low-income countries (LIC) struggle to report recommended metrics and this poses 
      a critical barrier to addressing unmet need. We present a comprehensive national 
      sample of surgical encounters from a LIC by assessing the National Health 
      Services of Mozambique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort of all 
      surgical encounters from Mozambique's National Health Service was gathered for 
      all provinces between July and December 2015. Primary outcomes were timely 
      access, provider densities for surgery, anesthesiology, and obstetrics (SAO) per 
      100,000 population, annualized surgical procedure volume per 100,000, and 
      postoperative mortality (POMR). Secondary outcomes include operating room density 
      and efficiency. RESULTS: Fifty-four hospitals had surgical capacity in 11 
      provinces with 47,189 surgeries. 44.9% of Mozambique's population lives in 
      Districts without access to surgical services. National SAO density was 
      1.2/100,000, ranging from 0.4/100,000 in Manica Province to 9.8/100,000 in Maputo 
      City. Annualized national surgical case volume was 367 procedures/100,000 
      population, ranging from 180/100,000 in Zambezia Province to 1,897/100,000 in 
      Maputo City. National POMR was 0.74% and ranged from 0.23% in Maputo Province to 
      1.78% in Niassa Province. DISCUSSION: Surgical delivery in Mozambique falls short 
      of international targets. Subnational deficiencies and variations between 
      provinces pose targets for quality improvement in advancing national surgical 
      plans. This serves as a template for LICs to follow in gathering surgical metrics 
      for the WHO and the World Bank and offers short- and long-term targets for 
      surgery as a component of health systems strengthening.

AB  - Pomalidomide (Pom) is an immunomodulatory drug that has efficacy against Kaposi's 
      sarcoma, a tumor caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Pom 
      also induces direct cytotoxicity in primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), a B-cell 
      malignancy caused by KSHV, in part through downregulation of IRF4, cMyc, and CK1α 
      as a result of its interaction with cereblon, a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase. 
      Additionally, Pom can reverse KSHV-induced downregulation of MHCI and 
      co-stimulatory immune surface molecules ICAM-1 and B7-2 on PELs. Here, we show 
      for the first time that Pom-induced increases in ICAM-1 and B7-2 on PEL cells 
      lead to an increase in both T-cell activation and NK-mediated cytotoxicity 
      against PEL. The increase in T-cell activation can be prevented by blocking 
      ICAM-1 and/or B7-2 on the PEL cell surface, suggesting that both ICAM-1 and B7-2 
      are important for T-cell co-stimulation by PELs. To gain mechanistic insights 
      into Pom's effects on surface markers, we generated Pom-resistant (PomR) PEL 
      cells, which showed about 90% reduction in cereblon protein level and only 
      minimal changes in IRF4 and cMyc upon Pom treatment. Pom no longer upregulated 
      ICAM-1 and B7-2 on the surface of PomR cells, nor did it increase T-cell and 
      NK-cell activation. Cereblon-knockout cells behaved similarly to the pomR cells 
      upon Pom-treatment, suggesting that Pom's interaction with cereblon is necessary 
      for these effects. Further mechanistic studies revealed PI3K signaling pathway as 
      being important for Pom-induced increases in these molecules. These observations 
      provide a rationale for the study of Pom as therapy in treating PEL and other 
      KSHV-associated tumors.

TI  - Indications and Outcomes for Non-Trauma Emergency Laparotomy: A Comparison of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency conditions requiring exploratory laparotomy (EL) can be 
      challenging. The objective of this study is to describe indications, outcomes, 
      and risk factors for perioperative mortality (POMR) after non-trauma EL. METHODS: 
      This was a prospective study of patients undergoing non-trauma EL at four 
      hospitals in Rwanda, South Africa, and the USA. Multivariate logistic regression 
      was used to determine factors associated with POMR. RESULTS: Over one year, there 
      were 632 EL with the most common indications appendicitis (n = 133, 21%), peptic 
      ulcer disease (PUD) (n = 101, 16%), and hernia (n = 74, 12%). In Rwanda, the most 
      common indications were appendicitis (n = 41, 19%) and hernia (n = 37, 17%); in 
      South Africa appendicitis (n = 91, 28%) and PUD (n = 60, 19%); and in the USA, 
      PUD (n = 16, 19%) and adhesions from small bowel obstruction (n = 16, 19%). POMR 
      was 11%, with no difference between countries (Rwanda 7%, South Africa 12%, US 
      16%, p = 0.173). Risk factors associated with increased odds of POMR included 
      typhoid intestinal perforation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 16.48; 95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 4.31, 62.98; p value < 0.001), mesenteric ischemia (aOR: 13.77, 
      95% CI: 4.21, 45.08, p value < 0.001), cancer (aOR: 5.84, 95% CI: 2.43, 14.05, p 
      value < 0.001), other diagnoses (aOR: 3.97, 95% CI: 3.03, 5.20, p value < 0.001), 
      high ASA score (score ≥ 3) (aOR: 3.95, 95% CI: 3.03, 5.15, p value < 0.001), 
      peptic ulcer disease (aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.64, 4.85, p value < 0.001), 
      age > 60 years (aOR: 2.32, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.83, p value = 0.001), and ICU 
      admission (aOR: 2.23, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.99, p value = 0.007). Surgery in the US was 
      associated with decreased odds of POMR (aOR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.80, p 
      value = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Indications for EL vary between countries and POMR 
      is high. Differences in mortality were associated with patient and disease 
      characteristics with certain diagnoses associated with increased risk of 
      mortality. Understanding the risk factors and outcomes for patients with EL can 
      assist providers in judicious patient selection, both for patient counselling and 
      resource allocation.

AB  - Expanding global access to safe surgical and anaesthesia care is crucial to meet 
      the health targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As global 
      surgical volume increases, improving safety throughout the patient care pathway 
      is a public health priority. At present, an estimated 4.2 million individuals die 
      within 30 days of surgery each year, and many of these deaths are preventable. 
      Important considerations for the collection and reporting of perioperative 
      mortality data have been identified in the literature, but consensus has not been 
      established on the best methodology for the quantification of excess surgical 
      mortality at a hospital or health system level. In this narrative review, we 
      address challenges in the use of perioperative mortality rates (POMR) for 
      improving patient safety. First, we discuss controversies in the use of POMR as a 
      health system indicator and suggest advantages for using a "basket" of 
      procedure-specific mortality rates as an adjunct to gross POMR. We offer then 
      solutions to challenges in the collection and reporting of POMR data, and propose 
      interventions for improving care in the preoperative, operative, and 
      postoperative periods. Finally, we discuss how health systems leaders and 
      frontline clinicians can integrate surgical safety into both national health 
      plans and patient care pathways to drive a sustainable safety revolution in 
      perioperative care.

AB  - The Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) is considered a key charting method to 
      support clinical care. Although not uniformly represented amongst digital health 
      systems, this paper presents a clinical model to represent multiple clinical 
      perspectives from a single problem list. The contextual problem list model is 
      defined according to primary diagnosis, comorbidities and problems arising from 
      the primary condition. It is represented within the patient record as a single 
      composition according to the prescribed context. The model pattern could help 
      alleviate the traditional criticisms of paper and digitally based problem 
      records.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Establishing an overall survival prognosis for resected glioblastoma 
      during routine postoperative management remains a challenge. The aim of our 
      single-center study was to assess the usefulness of basing survival analyses on 
      preradiotherapy MRI (PRMR) rather than on postoperative MRI (POMR). PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 75 patients with glioblastoma 
      treated at our institute. We collected overall survival and MRI volumetric data. 
      We analyzed two types of volumetric data: residual tumor volume and extent of 
      resection. Overall survival rates were compared according to these two types of 
      volumetric data, calculated on either POMR or PRMR and according to the presence 
      or absence of residual enhancement. RESULTS: Analysis of volumetric data revealed 
      progression of some residual tumors between POMR and PRMR. Kaplan-Meier analysis 
      of the correlations between extent of resection, residual tumor volume, and 
      overall survival revealed significant differences between POMR and PRMR data. 
      Both MRI scans indicated a difference between the complete resection subgroup and 
      the incomplete resection subgroup, as median overall survival was longer in 
      patients with complete resection. However, differences were significant for PRMR 
      (25.3 vs. 15.5, p =  0.012), but not for POMR (21.3 vs. 15.8 months, p =  0.145). 
      With a residual tumor volume cut-off value of 3 cm(3), Kaplan-Meier survival 
      analysis revealed non-significant differences on POMR (p =  0.323) compared with 
      PRMR (p =  0.007). CONCLUSION: Survival in patients with resected glioblastoma 
      was more accurately predicted by volumetric data acquired with PRMR. Differences 
      in predicted survival between the POMR and PRMR groups can be attributed to 
      changes in tumor behavior before adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Laparotomy Due to War-Related Penetrating Abdominal Trauma in Civilians: 
      Experience From Syria 2011-2017.
PG  - 615-623
LID - 10.1017/dmp.2020.77 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Penetrating abdominal trauma is one of the injuries that could affect 
      civilians in wartime. This retrospective study investigates the commonly injured 
      abdominal organs, and the impact of multiple injured organs on mortality. 
      METHODS: We reviewed the operating room (OR) logs of patients who presented to 
      the surgical emergency department (SED) at Al-Mouwasat University Hospital with 
      war-related abdominal penetrating trauma requiring exploratory laparotomy between 
      April 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017. RESULTS: Of 7826 patients with traumatic 
      injuries, 898 patients (11.5%) required exploratory laparotomy. Of all patients 
      who had an exploratory laparotomy (n = 898), 58 patients (6.5%) died in the 
      perioperative period. Regarding complete laparotomies (n = 873 patients), small 
      intestines, large intestines, and liver were the most commonly affected organs 
      (36.4%, 33%, 22.9%, respectively). A total of 92 patients (10.2%) had negative 
      laparotomy in which all the abdominal organs were not injured. The perioperative 
      mortality rate (POMR) increased when more organs/organ systems were injured per 
      patient reaching a peak at 3 organs/organ systems injuries with a POMR of 8.3%. 
      POMR was highest in patients with musculoskeletal injuries (18.2%), followed by 
      vascular injuries (11.8%), and liver injuries (7%). CONCLUSIONS: The management 
      of civilians' abdominal injuries remains a challenge for general and trauma 
      surgeons, especially the civilian trauma team. The number and type of injured 
      organs and their correlation with mortality should be considered during surgical 
      management of penetrating abdominal injuries.

TI  - Bellwether Procedures for Monitoring Subnational Variation of All-cause 
      Perioperative Mortality in Brazil.
PG  - 3299-3309
LID - 10.1007/s00268-020-05607-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: All-cause perioperative mortality rate (POMR) is a commonly reported 
      metric to assess surgical quality. Benchmarking POMR remains difficult due to 
      differences in surgical volume and case mix combined with the burden of reporting 
      and leveraging this complex and high-volume data. We seek to determine whether 
      the pooled and individual procedure POMR of each bellwether (cesarean section, 
      laparotomy, management of open fracture) correlate with state-level all-cause 
      POMR in the interest of identifying benchmark procedures that can be used to make 
      standardized regional comparisons of surgical quality. METHODS: The Brazilian 
      National Healthcare Database (DATASUS) was queried to identify unadjusted 
      all-cause POMR for all patient admissions among public hospitals in Brazil in 
      2018. Bellwether procedures were identified as any procedure involving 
      laparotomy, cesarean section, or treatment of open long bone fracture and then 
      classified as emergent or elective. The pooled POMR of all bellwether procedures 
      as well as for each individual bellwether procedure was compared with the 
      all-cause POMR in each of the 26 states, and one federal district and 
      correlations were calculated. Funnel plots were used to compare surgical volume 
      to perioperative mortality for each bellwether procedure. RESULTS: 4,756,642 
      surgical procedures were reported to DATASUS in 2018: 237,727 emergent procedures 
      requiring laparotomy, 852,821 emergent cesarean sections, and 210,657 open, long 
      bone fracture repairs. Pooled perioperative mortality for all of the bellwether 
      procedures was correlated with all-procedure POMR among states (r = 0.77, 
      p < 0.001). POMR for emergency procedures (2.4%) correlated with the 
      all-procedure (emergent and elective) POMR (1.6%, r = 0.93, p < .001), while POMR 
      for elective procedures (0.4%) did not (p = .247). POMR for emergency laparotomy 
      (4.4%) correlated with all-procedure POMR (1.6%, r = 0.52, p = .005), as did the 
      POMR for open, long bone fractures (0.8%, r = 0.61, p < .001). POMR for emergency 
      cesarean section (0.05%) did not correlate with all-procedure POMR (p = 0.400). 
      There was a correlation between surgical volume and emergency laparotomy POMR 
      (r = - 0.53, p = .004), but not for emergency cesarean section or open, long bone 
      fractures POMR. CONCLUSION: Procedure-specific POMR for laparotomy and open long 
      bone fracture correlates modestly with all-procedure POMR among Brazilian states 
      which is primarily driven by emergency procedure POMR. Selective reporting of 
      emergency laparotomy and open fracture POMR may be a useful surrogate to guide 
      subnational surgical policy decisions.

TI  - How will increasing surgical volume affect mortality in the Pacific, Papua New 
      Guinea and Timor Leste?
PG  - 1915-1919
LID - 10.1111/ans.15989 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nine South Pacific nations, Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste, have 
      collaborated to report and publish their surgical metrics as recommended by the 
      Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS). Currently, these countries 
      experience about 750 postoperative deaths per year, representing 1% of crude 
      mortality in the region. Given that more than 400 000 annual procedures are 
      needed in the nine nations to reach the LCoGS target of 5000/100 000, we aimed to 
      calculate the potential contribution of perioperative mortality to national 
      mortality where these procedures are performed. METHODS: We utilized reported 
      surgical metrics with current rates for surgical volume (SV) and perioperative 
      mortality (POMR), as well as World Bank/WHO mortality statistics, to predict the 
      likely impact of surgical scale-up to recommended targets by 2030. We tested 
      correlations between SV and POMR in countries from our region using Pearson's r 
      statistic. Funnel plots were used to evaluate the dataset for outliers. RESULTS: 
      Surgical scale up would result in perioperative mortality contributing on average 
      to 3.3% of all national crude mortality. This prediction assumes POMR stays the 
      same, which is challenging to predict. In our region countries that achieved the 
      LCoGS target (n = 5) had a lower POMR than countries that did not (n = 8). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Surgical volumes in the South Pacific region must increase to meet 
      the LCoGS target. Postoperative mortality as a proportion of all mortality may 
      increase with the surgical scale up, however, the overall number of premature 
      deaths is expected to reduce with better access to timely and safe surgical care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The optimal size of the health workforce for children's surgical care 
      around the world remains poorly defined. The goal of this study was to 
      characterise the surgical workforce for children across Brazil, and to identify 
      associations between the surgical workforce and measures of childhood health. 
      DESIGN: This study is an ecological, cross-sectional analysis using data from the 
      Brazil public health system (Sistema Único de Saúde). SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      We collected data on the surgical workforce (paediatric surgeons, general 
      surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nursing staff), perioperative mortality rate 
      (POMR) and under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) across Brazil for 2015. PRIMARY AND 
      SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We performed descriptive analyses, and identified 
      associations between the workforce and U5MR using geospatial analysis 
      (Getis-Ord-Gi analysis, spatial cluster analysis and linear regression models). 
      FINDINGS: There were 39 926 general surgeons, 856 paediatric surgeons, 13 243 
      anaesthesiologists and 103 793 nurses across Brazil in 2015. The U5MR ranged from 
      11 to 26 deaths/1000 live births and the POMR ranged from 0.11-0.17 deaths/100 
      000 children across the country. The surgical workforce is inequitably 
      distributed across the country, with the wealthier South and Southeast regions 
      having a higher workforce density as well as lower U5MR than the poorer North and 
      Northeast regions. Using linear regression, we found an inverse relationship 
      between the surgical workforce density and U5MR. An U5MR of 15 deaths/1000 births 
      across Brazil is associated with a workforce level of 5 paediatric surgeons, 200 
      surgeons, 100 anaesthesiologists or 700 nurses/100 000 children. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found wide disparities in the surgical workforce and childhood mortality across 
      Brazil, with both directly related to socioeconomic status. Areas of increased 
      surgical workforce are associated with lower U5MR. Strategic investment in the 
      surgical workforce may be required to attain optimal health outcomes for children 
      in Brazil, particularly in rural regions.

TI  - Epidemiology and Perioperative Mortality of Exploratory Laparotomy in Rural 
      Ghana.
PG  - 19

LID - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative mortality rate (POMR) has been identified as an 
      important measure of access to safe surgical and anesthesia care in global 
      surgery. There has been limited study on this measure in rural Ghana. In order to 
      identify areas for future quality improvement efforts, we aimed to assess the 
      epidemiology of exploratory laparotomy and to investigate POMR as a benchmark 
      quality measure. METHODS: Surgical records were reviewed at a regional referral 
      hospital in Eastern Region, Ghana to identify cases of exploratory laparotomy 
      from July 2017 through June 2018. Patient demographics, health information, and 
      outcomes data were collected. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors 
      of perioperative mortality. FINDINGS: The study included operations for 286 adult 
      and 60 pediatric patients. Only 60% of patients were covered by National Health 
      Insurance (NHI). The overall POMR was 11.5% (12.6% adults; 6.7% pediatric). Sixty 
      percent of mortalities were referrals from outside hospitals and the mortality 
      rate for referrals was 13.5%. Odds of mortality was 13 times greater with 
      perforated peptic ulcer disease (OR = 13.1, p = 0.025) and 12 times greater with 
      trauma (OR = 11.7, p = 0.042) when compared to the most common operation. Female 
      sex (OR = 0.3, p = 0.016) and NHI (OR = 0.4, p = 0.031) were protective 
      variables. Individuals 60 years and older (OR = 3.3, p = 0.016) had higher 
      mortality. CONCLUSION: POMR can be an important outcome and quality indicator for 
      rural populations. Interventions aimed at decreasing emergent hernia repair, 
      preventing perforation of peptic ulcer disease, improving rural infrastructure 
      for response to major trauma, and increasing NHI coverage may improve POMR in 
      rural Ghana.

TI  - Disparities in surgical care for children across Brazil: Use of geospatial

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health systems for surgical care for children in low- and 
      middle-income countries remain poorly understood. Our goal was to characterize 
      the delivery of surgical care for children across Brazil and to identify 
      associations between surgical resources and childhood mortality. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional, ecological study to analyze surgical care for 
      children in the public health system (Sistema Único de Saúde) across Brazil from 
      2010 to 2015. We collected data from several national databases, and used 
      geospatial analysis (two-step floating catchment, Getis-Ord-Gi analysis, and 
      geographically weighted regression) to explore relationships between 
      infrastructure, workforce, access, procedure rate, under-5 mortality rate (U5MR), 
      and perioperative mortality rate (POMR). RESULTS: A total of 246,769 surgical 
      procedures were performed in 6,007 first level/ district hospitals and 491 
      referral hospitals across Brazil over the study period. The surgical workforce is 
      distributed unevenly across the country, with 0.13-0.26 pediatric surgeons per 
      100,000 children in the poorer North, Northeast and Midwest regions, and 0.6-0.68 
      pediatric surgeons per 100,000 children in the wealthier South and Southeast 
      regions. Hospital infrastructure, procedure rate, and access to care is also 
      unequally distributed across the country, with increased resources in the South 
      and Southeast compared to the Northeast, North, and Midwest. The U5MR varies 
      widely across the country, although procedure-specific POMR is consistent across 
      regions. Increased access to care is associated with lower U5MR across Brazil, 
      and access to surgical care differs by geographic region independent of 
      socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: There are wide disparities in surgical care 
      for children across Brazil, with infrastructure, manpower, and resources 
      distributed unevenly across the country. Access to surgical care is associated 
      with improved U5MR independent of socioeconomic status. To address these 
      disparities, policy should direct the allocation of surgical resources 
      commensurate with local population needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This retrospective, population-based cohort study aims to determine 
      if differences in the regional distribution of procedures or variation in 
      regional mortality contributes to the variable pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) 
      mortality between Australian states and territories. METHODS: De-identified 
      procedural data from public hospitals between 1 July 2005 and 30 June 2015 from 
      the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare were analysed. The regional 
      distribution of procedures and variation in perioperative mortality rate (POMR) 
      were investigated in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Queensland (QLD) using 
      logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: NSW performed the highest proportion of 
      city-based procedures (93.8%) while QLD performed the highest proportion of 
      regional procedures (15.3%). QLD demonstrated the lowest city mortality (1.9%) 
      and lowest POMR overall (2.0%). City, regional and state-wide mortality was 
      highest in NSW (5.0%, 8.4% and 5.3%). No significant difference in POMR was 
      demonstrated between regional and city hospitals in each of the states (P = 0.46) 
      or across all states (P = 0.50). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates comparable 
      regional PD distribution across Australia. The difference in PD POMR between city 
      and regional areas was not found to be statistically significant. NSW exhibited 
      the highest city, regional and overall PD POMR, potentially warranting further 
      investigation.

TI  - The surgical burden of disease and perioperative mortality in patients admitted 
      to hospitals in Victoria, Australia: a population-level observational study.
PG  - e028671
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028671 [doi]
LID - e028671
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comprehensive reporting of surgical disease burden and outcomes are 
      vital components of resilient health systems but remain under-reported. The 
      primary objective was to identify the Victorian surgical burden of disease 
      necessitating treatment in a hospital or day centre, including a thorough 
      epidemiology of surgical procedures and their respective perioperative mortality 
      rates (POMR). DESIGN: Retrospective population-level observational study. 
      SETTING: The study was conducted in Victoria, Australia. Access to data from the 
      Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset was obtained using the Dr Foster Quality 
      Investigator tool. The study included public and private facilities, including 
      day-case facilities. PARTICIPANTS: From January 2014 to December 2016, all 
      admissions with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10 code 
      matched to the Global Health Estimates (GHE) disease categories were included. 
      PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Admissions were assigned a primary 
      disease category according to the 23 GHE disease categories. Surgical procedures 
      during hospitalisations were identified using the Australian Refined Diagnosis 
      Related Groups (AR-DRG). POMR were calculated for GHE disease categories and 
      AR-DRG procedures. RESULTS: A total of 4 865 226 admitted episodes were 
      identified over the 3-year period. 1 715 862 (35.3%) of these required a surgical 
      procedure. The mortality rate for those undergoing a procedure was 0.42%, and 
      1.47% for those without. The top five procedures performed per GHE category were 
      lens procedures (162 835 cases, POMR 0.001%), caesarean delivery (76 032 cases, 
      POMR 0.01%), abortion with operating room procedure (65 451 cases, POMR 0%), 
      hernia procedures (52 499 cases, POMR 0.05%) and other knee procedures (47 181 
      cases, POMR 0.004%). CONCLUSIONS: Conditions requiring surgery were responsible 
      for 35.3% of the hospital admitted disease burden in Victoria, a rate higher than 
      previously published from Sweden, New Zealand and the USA. POMR is comparable to 
      other studies reporting individual procedures and conditions, but has been 
      reported comprehensively across all GHE disease categories for the first time.

TI  - Perioperative Mortality Rates as a Health Metric for Acute Abdominal Surgery in 
      Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Review and Future Recommendations.
PG  - 1880-1889
LID - 10.1007/s00268-019-04993-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 5 billion people do not have access to safe, timely, 
      and affordable surgical and anesthesia care, with this number disproportionately 
      affecting those from low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Perioperative mortality 
      rates (POMRs) have been identified by the World Health Organization as a 
      potential health metric to monitor quality of surgical care provided. The purpose 
      of this systematic review was to evaluate published reports of POMR and suggest 
      recommendations for its appropriate use as a health metric. METHODS: The protocol 
      was registered a priori with PROSPERO. A peer-reviewed search strategy was 
      developed adhering with the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant articles were identified 
      through Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CDSR, LILACS, PubMed, BIOSIS, Global Health, 
      Africa-Wide Information, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Two independent 
      reviewers performed a primary screening analysis based on titles and abstracts, 
      followed by a full-text screen. Studies describing POMRs of adult emergency 
      abdominal surgeries in LMICs were included. RESULTS: A total of 7787 articles 
      were screened of which 7466 were excluded based on title and abstract. Three 
      hundred and twenty-one articles entered full-text screen of which 70 articles met 
      the inclusion criteria. Variables including timing of POMR reporting, 
      intraoperative mortality, length of hospital stay, complication rates, and 
      disease severity score were collected. Complication rates were reported in 83% of 
      studies and postoperative stay in 46% of studies. 40% of papers did not report 
      the specific timing of POMR collection. 7% of papers reported on intraoperative 
      death. Additionally, 46% of papers used a POMR timing specific to the duration of 
      their study. Vital signs were discussed in 24% of articles, with disease severity 
      score only mentioned in 20% of studies. CONCLUSION: POMR is an important health 
      metric for quantifications of quality of care of surgical systems. Further 
      validation and standardization are necessary to effectively use this health 
      metric.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The perioperative mortality rate (POMR) is used as a quality 
      indicator to monitor health care system performance at regional and national 
      levels. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health publishes national in-hospital 
      mortality rates for several indicator conditions and indicator operation types 
      (IORs). We investigated long-term time trends of POMRs from 1998-2014. In view of 
      continual advances in perioperative care, we expected to find decreasing trends. 
      METHODS: Non-cardiosurgical IORs containing aggregated age- and sex-specific data 
      (number of operations and deaths) for all years of the study period were included 
      to calculate age-standardised POMRs using the 2013 European Standard Population. 
      We assessed calendar time trends of POMRs using multivariable Poisson regression. 
      We categorised IORs according to the type of time trend (decreasing, unchanged, 
      or increasing incident rate ratio) and mean risk levels (age-adjusted POMR). 
      RESULTS: A total of 22 IORs were included, comprising 1,561,012 operations and 
      22,140 deaths (overall crude POMR 1.42%). POMR trends decreased for 6 IORs 
      representing 26.8% of operations, remained unchanged for 13 IORs (56.9% of 
      operations), and increased for 3 IORs (16.4% of operations). IOR categorisation 
      according to POMR trends and to risk levels yielded four groups. (1) Decreasing 
      POMR trends, low- to intermediate-risk IORs (age-adjusted POMR 0.2-2.2%): 
      cholecystectomy; arterial pelvic/leg aneurysm or dissection operation; femoral 
      neck fracture; trochanteric fractures; gastric, duodenal or jejunal ulcer 
      resection; major pulmonary or bronchial resection. (2) Unchanged POMR trends, 
      low-risk IORs (0.1-0.9%): transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR prostate); 
      hernia repair without intestinal operation; hysterectomy; extracranial vascular 
      operation; nephrectomy; amputation foot, non-traumatic. (3) Unchanged POMR 
      trends, intermediate-risk IORs (1.7-3.8%): hernia repair with intestinal 
      operation; gastric carcinoma resection; non-ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      (open operation); arterial pelvic/leg thromboembolic operation; colorectal 
      resection, pancreatic resection; complex oesophageal procedure. (4) Increasing 
      POMR trends, low- to high-risk IORs (0.1-5.2%): hip endoprosthesis; cystectomy; 
      amputation lower limb. Impact of sex on POMR: hysterectomy and TUR prostate 
      comprised 19.7% of all operations; among the remaining operations, 68.5% showed 
      significantly lower and 27.1% significantly higher POMRs in females. 4.4% showed 
      no sex difference. CONCLUSIONS: In Switzerland, in-hospital POMR trends from 
      1998-2014 were unchanged or even increasing for the majority of IORs (73% of 
      included operations). Our analysis used age-standardisation but cannot account 
      for changes in coding practices and organisation of healthcare delivery. POMR 
      trends should be systematically monitored at the national level and used to guide 
      priorities in national quality improvement strategies.

TI  - PROBLEM-ORIENTED MEDICAL RECORD AS A CHALLENGE FOR NARRATOLOGICAL ANALYSIS.
PG  - 180-183
AB  - The paper examines the narrative arrangement of the problem-oriented medical 
      record (POMR) as an effective method of registering and assessing clinical data. 
      The aim of the research is to examine the types of narrators and focalization, as 
      well as the hierarchy and interaction of narrative levels in the analyzed 
      discourse. The research has demonstrated the presence of several types of 
      narrators within the analyzed discourse: (1) the omniscient hetero-extradiegetic 
      narrator with transient internal focalization (the third-person narration, 
      represented by the physician) and (2) homo-intradiegetic narration (patient's 
      first-person narration) in the "Subjective Observation" section; (3) the 
      "estranged" heterodiegetic narrator with external focalization (the "Objective 
      Observation" part); (4) the "uncertain" type of narrator (the "Assessment" part); 
      (5) and the imperative mode of narration (the "Plan" section). Each section of 
      POMR is characterized by a specific type of narration, and each of them aims to 
      "intertwine" the events, scattered in time and space, into one coherent narrative 
      to ensure the effective communication between physicians and successful treatment 
      of patients. It is highly important for future physicians to develop narrative 
      competence and master the basic mechanisms of producing an effective POMR, in 
      order to be able to accurately document the encounters with patients, elicit the 
      relevant details from case histories, and select the appropriate strategy of 
      treatment. Therefore, in the process of training future doctors, the analysis of 
      the basic mechanisms of writing POMRs should be an integral part of the curricula 
      in English for Specific Purposes at universities.

TI  - Perioperative mortality rates in low-income and middle-income countries: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e000810
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2018-000810 [doi]
LID - e000810
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed the perioperative 
      mortality rate (POMR) as one of the six key indicators of the strength of a 
      country's surgical system. Despite its widespread use in high-income settings, 
      few studies have described procedure-specific POMR across low-income and 
      middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to estimate POMR across a wide range of 
      surgical procedures in LMICs. We also describe how POMR is defined and reported 
      in the LMIC literature to provide recommendations for future monitoring in 
      resource-constrained settings. METHODS: We did a systematic review of studies 
      from LMICs published from 2009 to 2014 reporting POMR for any surgical procedure. 
      We extracted select variables in duplicate from each included study and pooled 
      estimates of POMR by type of procedure using random-effects meta-analysis of 
      proportions and the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation to stabilise 
      variances. RESULTS: We included 985 studies conducted across 83 LMICs, covering 
      191 types of surgical procedures performed on 1 020 869 patients. Pooled POMR 
      ranged from less than 0.1% for appendectomy, cholecystectomy and caesarean 
      delivery to 20%-27% for typhoid intestinal perforation, intracranial haemorrhage 
      and operative head injury. We found no consistent associations between 
      procedure-specific POMR and Human Development Index (HDI) or income-group apart 
      from emergency peripartum hysterectomy POMR, which appeared higher in low-income 
      countries. Inpatient mortality was the most commonly used definition, though only 
      46.2% of studies explicitly defined the time frame during which deaths accrued. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve access to surgical care in LMICs should be 
      accompanied by investment in improving the quality and safety of care. To improve 
      the usefulness of POMR as a safety benchmark, standard reporting items should be 
      included with any POMR estimate. Choosing a basket of procedures for which POMR 
      is tracked may offer institutions and countries the standardisation required to 
      meaningfully compare surgical outcomes across contexts and improve population 
      health outcomes.

TI  - Variability of perioperative mortality of hepatic resection in Australia.
PG  - 1022-1027
LID - 10.1111/ans.14408 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatic resection is a relatively young and complex specialized 
      procedure. A strong relationship between volume and perioperative mortality has 
      been reported internationally. However, there has been no multicentre study into 
      hepatic resection in Australia. This retrospective, population-based cohort study 
      was conducted to determine national, state and territory based volume and 
      perioperative mortality rates (POMRs). METHODS: Australian Institute of Health 
      and Welfare data was interrogated for the Australian Classification of Health 
      Intervention codes for hepatic resection defined as extended hemi-hepatectomy 
      (30421), hemi-hepatectomy (30418), segmental hepatic resection (30415) and 
      sub-segmental hepatic resection (30414). Logistic regression analysis was 
      performed using the de-identified data to investigate trends and differences 
      between states/territories. Mortality rates were risk adjusted for age, gender 
      and public or private admission. The data set included patients who underwent 
      hepatic resection in the financial years 2005/2006 to 2012/2013. RESULTS: The 
      overall POMR for all types of hepatic resection was 1.6% (201/12 562). There was 
      no significant change in POMR over time. However, there was significant variation 
      between the states and territories with two states having significantly higher 
      POMR for major hepatic resections (regional range: 1.3-3.8%). POMRs increased 
      with age with the highest mortality seen in the 75-79 year age group. The POMR 
      was lower in private than in public hospitals. CONCLUSION: The results of this 
      study confirm that the overall Australian POMR for major hepatic resection is 
      similar to results reported internationally. National and state/territory POMR 
      has not varied significantly over time. The significant variation between 
      states/territories warrants further investigation.

TI  - How Much Data are Good Enough? Using Simulation to Determine the Reliability of 
      Estimating POMR for Resource-Constrained Settings.
PG  - 2344-2347
LID - 10.1007/s00268-018-4529-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Perioperative mortality rate (POMR) is a suggested indicator for 
      surgical quality worldwide. Currently, POMR is often sampled by convenience; a 
      data-driven approach for calculating sample size has not previously been 
      attempted. We proposed a novel application of a bootstrapping sampling technique 
      to estimate how much data are needed to be collected to reasonably estimate POMR 
      in low-resource countries where 100% data capture is not possible. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Six common procedures in low- and middle-income countries were analysed 
      by using population database in New York and California. Relative margin of error 
      by dividing the absolute margin of error by the true population rate was 
      calculated. Target margin of error was ±50%, because this level of precision 
      would allow us to detect a moderate-to-large effect size. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 
      Target margin of error was achieved at 0.3% sampling size for abdominal surgery, 
      7% for fracture, 10% for craniotomy, 16% for pneumonectomy, 26% for hysterectomy 
      and 60% for C-section. POMR may be estimated with fairly good reliability with 
      small data sampling. This method demonstrates that it is possible to use a 
      data-driven approach to determine the necessary sampling size to accurately 
      collect POMR worldwide.

TI  - Perioperative Mortality Following Bariatric Surgery in Australia.
PG  - 1329-1334
LID - 10.1007/s11695-017-3010-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is the most effective method of sustainable weight 
      loss for the treatment of morbid obesity. Low mortality associated with these 
      procedures has been reported internationally; however, Australian outcomes are 
      yet to be published. Despite its efficacy, limited access to bariatric surgery 
      exists in Australian public hospitals. This retrospective data analysis was 
      conducted for two reasons. Firstly, to determine the perioperative mortality rate 
      (POMR) associated with bariatric procedures in Australia, and secondly, to 
      compare public and private hospital bariatric surgery admission demographics and 
      outcomes. METHOD: A retrospective review of de-identified patient data from the 
      National Hospital Morbidity Database, held by the Australian Institute of Health 
      and Welfare (AIHW), was conducted using codes relating to bariatric procedures. 
      POMR calculations were established using AIHW admission data from 1 July 2005 to 
      30 June 2013. RESULTS: From 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2013, 113,929 patient 
      admissions occurred for patients undergoing a bariatric procedure. Thirty-nine 
      deaths occurred nationally, with an overall average POMR of 0.03%. A higher POMR 
      was associated with public admissions and secondary procedures. A higher 
      proportion of secondary procedures were performed in public hospitals. Primary 
      bariatric procedure incidence increased throughout the study period while 
      secondary bariatric procedure incidence decreased. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates the Australian bariatric procedure POMR to be substantially lower 
      than internationally reported figures. Public hospitals were shown to perform far 
      fewer bariatric procedures at a higher POMR than private hospitals. Public 
      hospitals performed a higher proportion of secondary revision procedures.

TI  - Rendering Problem-Oriented CCD for chronic diseases.
PG  - 4277-4280
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2017.8037801 [doi]
AB  - Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is an XML-based clinical document standard 
      designed to ensure data exchange as well as semantic interoperability of 
      healthcare information systems. Continuity care of documents (CCD), a template 
      derived from CDA, is designed with the goal of displaying patient records more 
      intuitively for clinicians, especially for when the patient has a long history of 
      medical care.The rate of chronic patients in the general population has increased 
      as longevity has increased substantially in the past few decades, and the trend 
      towards longer and more complex medical records has made it time-consuming to 
      read patient data even in the CCD document. The problem-oriented medical record 
      (POMR) is an easily readable medical record style and it has been widely adopted 
      in electronic health record (EHR) services in Europe. Unfortunately, POMR has not 
      been integrated with the CCD-compatible representation so far. Hence this paper 
      proposes Problem-Oriented CCD (PO-CCD) rendering based on CDA and POMR. To find 
      out how a PO-CCD would be viewed by healthcare professionals and healthcare IT 
      professionals, we drafted a few Problem-oriented CCD example documents and 
      conducted a survey on their impression. Among our 41 respondents, 60% replied 
      they would like to view patient charts in our Problem-Oriented CCD rendering 
      side-by-side with the conventional CCD rather than the conventional CCD alone.

TI  - Perioperative Mortality Following Oesophagectomy and Pancreaticoduodenectomy in 
      Australia.
PG  - 742-748
LID - 10.1007/s00268-017-4204-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oesophagectomy (OG) and pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remain 
      associated with significant perioperative mortality rates (POMR). Improved 
      outcomes in high-volume centres have led to these procedures being centralised in 
      some countries. This retrospective, population-based cohort study was conducted 
      to determine the Australian national, and state and territory based POMR 
      associated with OG and PD, and assess trends over time. METHODS: Logistic 
      regression analysis was performed using de-identified procedural data between 1 
      July 2005 and 30 June 2013 from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 
      Codes relating to OG and PD contained in the Australian Classification of Health 
      Interventions were used to extract patient data. Mortality rates were risk 
      adjusted for age, gender and urgency of admission. Temporal trends and 
      differences between states/territories were investigated. RESULTS: The average 
      Australian POMR throughout the study period was 3.5 and 3.0% for OG and PD, 
      respectively. OG POMR showed no significant change over time (P = 0.30) or 
      variation between states (P = 0.079). The annual POMR associated with PD, 
      however, showed a significant decrease during the study period (P = 0.01) with 
      variation in PD POMR outcomes evident amongst different regions (P = 0.0004). 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a comparable Australian PD and OG POMR when 
      correlated with international studies. National PD POMR improved throughout the 
      study with consistent improvement across the states and territories. This study 
      does, however, show variation in PD POMR between states and territories. 
      Potential intra-state variation merits further investigation.

TI  - Assessing the Brazilian surgical system with six surgical indicators: a 
      descriptive and modelling study.
PG  - e000226
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000226 [doi]
LID - e000226
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brazil boasts a health scheme that aspires to provide universal 
      coverage, but its surgical system has rarely been analysed. In an effort to 
      strengthen surgical systems worldwide, the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery 
      proposed a collection of 6 standardised indicators: 2-hour access to surgery, 
      surgical workforce density, surgical volume, perioperative mortality rate (POMR) 
      and protection against impoverishing and catastrophic expenditure. This study 
      aims to characterise the Brazilian surgical health system with these newly 
      devised indicators while gaining understanding on the complexity of the 
      indicators themselves. METHODS: Using Brazil's national healthcare database, 
      commonly reported healthcare variables were used to calculate or simulate the 6 
      surgical indicators. Access to surgery was calculated using hospital locations, 
      surgical workforce density was calculated using locations of surgeons, 
      anaesthesiologists and obstetricians (SAO), and surgical volume and POMR were 
      identified with surgical procedure codes. The rates of protection against 
      impoverishing and catastrophic expenditure were modelled using cost of surgical 
      inpatient hospitalisations and a γ distribution of incomes based on Gini and 
      gross domestic product/capita. FINDINGS: In 2014, SAO density was 34.7/100 000 
      population, surgical volume was 4433 procedures/100 000 people and POMR was 
      1.71%. 79.4% of surgical patients were protected against impoverishing 
      expenditure and 84.6% were protected against catastrophic expenditure due to 
      surgery each year. 2-hour access to surgery was not able to be calculated from 
      national health data, but a proxy measure suggested that 97.2% of the population 
      has 2-hour access to a hospital that may be able to provide surgery. Geographic 
      disparities were seen in all indicators. INTERPRETATION: Brazil's public surgical 
      system meets several key benchmarks. Geographic disparities, however, are 
      substantial and raise concerns of equity. Policies should focus on stimulating 
      appropriate geographic allocation of the surgical workforce and better 
      distribution of surgical volume. In some cases, where benchmarks for each 
      indicator are met, supplemental analysis can further inform our understanding of 
      health systems. This measured and systematic evaluation should be encouraged for 
      all nations seeking to better understand their surgical systems.

TI  - An Alternative Paradigm for Evidence-Based Medicine: Revisiting Lawrence Weed, 
      MD's Systems Approach.
PG  - 16-147
LID - 10.7812/TPP/16-147 [doi]
LID - 16-147
AB  - Lawrence Weed, MD, is renowned for being the father of the Problem-Oriented 
      Medical Record (POMR), the medical care standard for collecting, managing, and 
      contextualizing patient data in medical records. What have been consistently 
      overlooked are his teachings on knowledge coupling, which refers to matching 
      patient data with associated medical knowledge. Together, the POMR standard and 
      knowledge coupling are meant to form the basis of a systems approach that enables 
      individualized evidence-based decision making within the context of 
      multimorbidity and patient complexity.The POMR and knowledge coupling tools 
      operationalize a problem-oriented model that reflects a sophisticated general 
      systems theoretical approach to knowledge. This paradigm transcends reductionist 
      approaches to knowledge by depicting how the meaning of specific entities (eg, 
      disease constructs) and their associated probabilities can only be understood 
      within their respective spatiotemporal and biopsychosocial relational contexts. 
      Rigorous POMRs therefore require knowledge inputs from a network of 
      interconnections among specific entities, which Dr Weed enabled through 
      development of the Knowledge Net standard. The Knowledge Net's relational 
      structure determines the applicability of knowledge within specific patient 
      contexts. To enable the linkage of unique combinations of data in individual 
      patient POMRs with existing medical knowledge structured in Knowledge Nets, Dr 
      Weed developed the Knowledge Coupling standard.Dr Weed's standards for record 
      keeping and knowledge coupling form the basis of a combinatorial approach to 
      evidence-based medicine that fulfills Stange's call for a science of 
      connectedness. Ensuing individualized processes of care become the dynamo 
      powering a learning health care system that enables a co-construction of health 
      premised on empowerment and intelligent human decision making, rather than 
      promoting the artificial intelligence of tools. If the value of Engel's 
      biopsychosocial model indeed relates to "guiding the parsimonious application of 
      medical knowledge to the needs of each patient," Dr Weed's approach warrants 
      serious consideration.

TI  - Perioperative Mortality Rates in Australian Public Hospitals: The Influence of 
      Age, Gender and Urgency.
PG  - 2591-2597
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A decline in surgical deaths has been observed in Australia since 
      the introduction of the Australian and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality 
      (ANZASM). The current study was conducted to determine whether the perioperative 
      mortality rate (POMR) has also declined. METHODS: This study is a retrospective 
      review of the POMR for surgical procedures in Australian public hospitals between 
      July 2009 and June 2013, using data obtained from the Australian Institute of 
      Health and Welfare. Operative procedures contained in the Australian Refined 
      Diagnosis Related Groups were selected and the POMR was modelled using urgency of 
      admission, age and gender as explanatory covariates. RESULTS: The POMR in 
      Australian public hospitals reduced by 15.4 % over the 4-year period. The 
      emergency admissions POMR dropped from 1.40 to 1.12 %, and the elective 
      admissions POMR from 0.09 to 0.08 %. The binary logistic regression model used to 
      predict patient mortality showed emergency admissions to have a higher POMR than 
      elective, being more evident at older ages. For emergency admissions, the 
      difference in POMR between females and males increased with age, from about 
      55 years onwards, with females being lower. For elective surgeries, the 
      difference between males and females was of little practical importance across 
      ages. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the POMR in Australia confirms the reduction 
      in surgical deaths reported to ANZASM. Continuing to monitor POMR will be 
      important to ensure the safest surgery in Australia. Further investigations into 
      case-mix will allow better risk adjustment and comparison between regions and 
      time-periods, to facilitate continuous quality improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A problem-oriented approach is one of the possibilities to organize a 
      medical record. The problem-oriented medical record (POMR) - a structured 
      organization of patient information per presented medical problem- was introduced 
      at the end of the sixties by Dr. Lawrence Weed to aid dealing with the 
      multiplicity of patient problems. The problem list as a precondition is the 
      centerpiece of the problem-oriented medical record (POMR) also called 
      problem-oriented record (POR). Prior to the digital era, paper records presented 
      a flat list of medical problems to the healthcare professional without the 
      features that are possible with current technology. In modern EHRs a POMR based 
      on a structured problem list can be used for clinical decision support, 
      registries, order management, population health, and potentially other innovative 
      functionality in the future, thereby providing a new incentive to the 
      implementation and use of the POMR. METHODS: On both 12 May 2014 and 1 June 2015 
      a systematic literature search was conducted. From the retrieved articles 
      statements regarding the POMR and related to successful or non-successful 
      implementation, were categorized. Generic determinants were extracted from these 
      statements. RESULTS: In this research 38 articles were included. The literature 
      analysis led to 12 generic determinants: clinical practice/reasoning, complete 
      and accurate problem list, data structure/content, efficiency, functionality, 
      interoperability, multi-disciplinary, overview of patient information, quality of 
      care, system support, training of staff, and usability. CONCLUSIONS: Two main 
      subjects can be distinguished in the determinants: the system that the problem 
      list and POMR is integrated in and the organization using that system. The 
      combination of the two requires a sociotechnical approach and both are equally 
      important for successful implementation of a POMR. All the determinants have to 
      be taken into account, but the weight given to each of the determinants depends 
      on the organizationusing the problem list or POMR.

TI  - Perioperative mortality: Analysis of 3 years of operative data across 7 general 
      surgical projects of Médecins Sans Frontières in Democratic Republic of Congo, 
      Central African Republic, and South Sudan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The African continent has the greatest burden of surgical 
      disability-adjusted life years, yet the least is known about operative care here. 
      This analysis describes the surgical patients admitted to 7 hospitals supported 
      by the Médécins Sans Frontières (MSF) over 3 years in 3 conflict-affected 
      countries-Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and 
      South Sudan. METHODS: A standardized operative data collection tool was used for 
      routine collection of operative inpatient data between 2011 and 2013 at 7 MSF 
      surgical facilities. Surgical records of 14,482 patients were analyzed to 
      describe surgical epidemiology, major procedures, and perioperative mortality. 
      The perioperative mortality rate (POMR) was calculated within 2 days of admission 
      (POMR2) and within 30 days from admission (POMR30). The POMR is used as a marker 
      of quality of operative care. RESULTS: Caesarean delivery was the most common 
      major procedure performed and had a POMR30 of 5.28 per 1,000 admissions. The 
      overall inpatient mortality was 19.67 per 1,000 admissions. Children had greater 
      POMR than adults for the same procedure types (47.97 vs 15.89 deaths per 1,000 
      admissions, P < .001); 85.1% of all major procedures were emergency procedures 
      and between 3 and 30% of admissions were related to violence. After adjustment, 
      perioperative death was associated with emergency surgery, violence, and age 
      younger than 15 years. CONCLUSION: POMRs varied by age group and type of major 
      procedure performed. Collecting surgical data is achievable and can inform future 
      planning and support for national surgical programs. More information is needed 
      on operative outcomes in adults and children in low-resource settings to improve 
      quality and access to care.

TI  - Associations with Perioperative Mortality Rate at a Major Referral Hospital in 
      Rwanda.
PG  - 784-90
LID - 10.1007/s00268-015-3308-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about perioperative mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. 
      The perioperative mortality rate (POMR) and associated factors at a major 
      referral hospital in Rwanda were measured. METHODS: The operative activity at 
      University Teaching Hospital of Kigali was evaluated through an operative 
      database. As a part of this larger study, patient characteristics and outcomes 
      were measured to determine areas for improvement in patient care. Data were 
      collected on patient demographics, surgeon, diagnosis, and operation over a 
      12-month period. The primary outcome was POMR. Secondary outcomes were timing and 
      hospital location of death. RESULTS: The POMR was 6 %. POMR in patients under 5 
      years of age was 10 %, 3 % in patients 5-14 years and 6 % in patients age >14 
      years. For emergency and elective operations, POMR was 9 and 2 %, respectively. 
      POMR was associated with emergency status, congenital anomalies, repeat 
      operations, referral outside Kigali, and female gender. Orthopedic procedures and 
      age 5-14 years were associated with decreased odds of mortality. Forty-nine 
      percent of deaths occurred in the post-operative recovery room and 35 % of deaths 
      occurred within the first post-operative day. CONCLUSIONS: The POMR at a large 
      referral hospital in Rwanda is <10 % demonstrating that surgery can save lives 
      even in resource-limited settings. Emergency operations are associated with 
      higher mortality, which could potentially be improved with faster identification 
      and transfer from district hospitals. Nearly half of deaths occurred in the 
      post-operative recovery room. Multidisciplinary audits of operative mortalities 
      could help guide improvements in surgical care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aggregate and risk-stratified perioperative mortality rates (POMR) 
      are well-documented in high-income countries where surgical databases are common. 
      In many low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) settings, such data are 
      unavailable, compromising efforts to understand and improve surgical outcomes. We 
      undertook a systematic review to determine how POMR is used and defined in LMICs 
      and to inform baseline rates. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all articles 
      published between Jan 1, 2009, and Sept 1, 2014, reporting surgical mortality in 
      LMICs. Search criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and study assessment 
      methodology are reported in the appendix. Titles and abstracts were screened 
      independently by two reviewers. Full-text review and data extraction were 
      completed by four trained clinician coders with regular validation for 
      consistency. We extracted the definition of POMR used, clinical risk scores 
      reported, and strategies for risk adjustment in addition to reported mortality 
      rates. FINDINGS: We screened 2657 abstracts and included 373 full-text articles. 
      493 409 patients in 68 countries and 12 surgical specialties were represented. 
      The most common definition for the numerator of POMR was in-hospital deaths 
      following surgery (55·3%) and for the denominator it was the number of operative 
      patients (96·2%). Few studies reported preoperative comorbidities (41·8%), ASA 
      status (11·3%), and HIV status (7·8%), with a smaller proportion stratifying on 
      or adjusting mortality for these factors. Studies reporting on planned procedures 
      recorded a median mortality of 1·2% (n=121 [IQR 0·0-4·7]). Median mortality was 
      10·1% (n=182 [IQR 2·5-16·2) for emergent procedures. INTERPRETATION: POMR is 
      frequently reported in LMICs, but a standardised approach for reporting and risk 
      stratification is absent from the literature. There was wide variation in POMR 
      across procedures and specialties. A quality assessment checklist for surgical 
      mortality studies could improve mortality reporting and facilitate benchmarking 
      across sites and countries. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Case volume per 100 000 population and perioperative mortality rate 
      (POMR) are key indicators to monitor and strengthen surgical services. However, 
      comparisons of POMR have been restricted by absence of standardised approaches to 
      when it is measured, the ideal denominator, need for risk adjustment, and whether 
      data are available. We aimed to address these issues and recommend a minimum 
      dataset by analysing four large mixed surgical datasets, two from well-resourced 
      settings with sophisticated electronic patient information systems and two from 
      resource-limited settings where clinicians maintain locally developed databases. 
      METHODS: We obtained data from the New Zealand (NZ) National Minimum Dataset, the 
      Geelong Hospital patient management system in Australia, and purpose-built 
      surgical databases in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa (PMZ) and Port Moresby, 
      Papua New Guinea (PNG). Information was sought on inclusion and exclusion 
      criteria, coding criteria, and completeness of patient identifiers, admission, 
      procedure, discharge and death dates, operation details, urgency of admission, 
      and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. Date-related errors were 
      defined as missing dates and impossible discrepancies. For every site, we then 
      calculated the POMR, the effect of admission episodes or procedures as 
      denominator, and the difference between in-hospital POMR and 30-day POMR. To 
      determine the need for risk adjustment, we used univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regression to assess the effect on relative POMR for each site of age, 
      admission urgency, ASA score, and procedure type. FINDINGS: 1 365 773 patient 
      admissions involving 1 514 242 procedures were included, among which 8655 deaths 
      were recorded within 30 days. Database inclusion and exclusion criteria differed 
      substantially. NZ and Geelong records had less than 0·1% date-related errors and 
      greater than 99·9% completeness. PMZ databases had 99·9% or greater completeness 
      of all data except date-related items (94·0%). PNG had 99·9% or greater 
      completeness for date of birth or age and admission date and operative procedure, 
      but 80-83% completeness of patient identifiers and date related items. Coding of 
      procedures was not standardised, and only NZ recorded ASA status and complete 
      post-discharge mortality. In-hospital POMR range was 0·38% in NZ to 3·44% in PMZ, 
      and in NZ it underestimated 30-day POMR by roughly a third. The difference in 
      POMR by procedures instead of admission episodes as denominator ranged from 10% 
      to 70%. Age older than 65 years and emergency admission had large independent 
      effects on POMR, but relatively little effect in multivariate analysis on the 
      relative odds of in-hospital death at each site. INTERPRETATION: Hospitals can 
      collect and provide data for case volume and POMR without sophisticated 
      electronic information systems. POMR should initially be defined by in-hospital 
      mortality because post-discharge deaths are not usually recorded, and with 
      procedures as denominator because details allowing linkage of several operations 
      within one patient's admission are not always present. Although age and admission 
      urgency are independently associated with POMR, and ASA and case mix were not 
      included, risk adjustment might not be essential because the relative odds 
      between sites persisted. Standardisation of inclusion criteria and definitions is 
      needed, as is attention to accuracy and completeness of dates of procedures, 
      discharge and death. A one-page, paper-based form, or alternatively a simple 
      electronic data collection form, containing a minimum dataset commenced in the 
      operating theatre could facilitate this process. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a vast unmet need for surgical interventions in resource 
      scarce settings. The poorest 2 billion people share 3·5% of the world's 
      operations. The highest burden of surgical disease is seen in Africa where 
      surgery could avert many deaths. Prospective studies investigating interventions, 
      indications, and outcomes including perioperative mortality rates (POMR) after 
      surgery are scant. The aim of the study was to describe the situation of surgery 
      in a low-income setting in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this descriptive, 
      facility-based study, data were prospectively collected in questionnaires by 41 
      staff employed at two hospitals (Iganga General Hospital and Buluba Mission 
      Hospital) in eastern Uganda during 4 months (major surgeries) and 3 months (minor 
      surgeries) in 2011. Data included patient characteristics, interventions, 
      indications for surgery, and in-hospital mortality after surgery. Descriptive 
      statistical methods were used to analyse the data. FINDINGS: 2701 patients 
      underwent 2790 surgical interventions. Of these, 1051 patients underwent major 
      surgery, which corresponds to a major surgery rate of 224·8 per 100 000 
      population. Most patients undergoing major surgery were women (n=923, 88%). 
      Pregnancy related complications (n=747, 66%) leading to caesarean section (n=496, 
      47%) and evacuation (n=244, 22%) or gynaecological conditions (n=114, 10%) were 
      common indications for surgery. General surgery interventions registered were 
      herniorrhaphy (n=103, 9%), explorative laparotomy (n=60, 5%), and appendicectomy 
      (n=31, 3%). Overall, the POMR was 0·6% (16 deaths); for major surgery it was 1·3% 
      (14 deaths) and for minor surgeries it was 0·1% (two of 1650 patients). High POMR 
      were seen following explorative laparotomy (13·3%, eight deaths) and caesarean 
      section (0·8%, four deaths). Of the 510 babies delivered through caesarean 
      section, 59 (12%) were still born or died before discharge. INTERPRETATION: Rates 
      of surgery are low in the study setting compared with in high-income settings 
      where surgical rates exceed 11 000 per 100 000 population. POMR are high after 
      exploratory laparotomy and caesarean section. Although very detailed, a larger 
      study could be undertaken to investigate the situation in other settings. 
      Underlying reasons leading to death and quality of surgical care should be 
      investigated further so that POMR can be reduced in this setting. FUNDING: The 
      Swedish Society of Medicine and the Golje Foundation.

TI  - Problem Oriented Medical Record: Characterizing the Use of the Problem List at 
      Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires.
PG  - 877
AB  - Problem oriented medical record (POMR) was born in late sixties. Expecting an 
      ordered, complete and updated medical record were some of the goals of its 
      founder. Several healthcare institutions have included problem list into their 
      clinical records but some concerns have been reported. These concerns are in 
      reference to their voluminosity, incompleteness and outdatedness. This study 
      attempts to understand how healthcare professionals are using the problem list at 
      Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA). We believe it is essential to 
      understand the local reality applied to our own applications and cultural 
      instances of documentation. This report is the basis from which several 
      improvements could be made in order to meet the goals of Weed's proposal.

TI  - An algorithm to improve diagnostic accuracy in diabetes in computerised problem 
      orientated medical records (POMR) compared with an established algorithm 
      developed in episode orientated records (EOMR).
PG  - 255-64
LID - 10.14236/jhi.v22i2.79 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An algorithm that detects errors in diagnosis, classification or 
      coding of diabetes in primary care computerised medial record (CMR) systems is 
      currently available. However, this was developed on CMR systems that are episode 
      orientated medical records (EOMR); and do not force the user to always code a 
      problem or link data to an existing one. More strictly problem orientated medical 
      record (POMR) systems mandate recording a problem and linking consultation data 
      to them. OBJECTIVE: To compare the rates of detection of diagnostic accuracy 
      using an algorithm developed in EOMR with a new POMR specific algorithm. METHOD: 
      We used data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (N = 2,466,364) 
      to identify a population of 100,513 (4.08%) patients considered likely to have 
      diabetes. We recalibrated algorithms designed to classify cases of diabetes to 
      take account of that POMR enforced coding consistency in the computerised medical 
      record systems [In Practice Systems (InPS) Vision] that contribute data to THIN. 
      We explored the different proportions of people classified as having type 1 
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and with diabetes 
      unclassifiable as either T1DM or T2DM. We compared proportions using chi-square 
      tests and used Tukey's test to compare the characteristics of the people in each 
      group. RESULTS: The prevalence of T1DM using the original EOMR algorithm was 
      0.38% (9,264/2,466,364), and for T2DM 3.22% (79,417/2,466,364). The prevalence 
      using the new POMR algorithm was 0.31% (7,750/2,466,364) T1DM and 3.65% 
      (89,990/2,466,364) T2DM. The EOMR algorithms also left more people unclassified 
      11,439 (12%), as to their type of diabetes compared with 2,380 (2.4%), for the 
      new algorithm. Those people who were only classified by the EOMR system differed 
      in terms of older age, and apparently better glycaemic control, despite not being 
      prescribed medication for their diabetes (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: Increasing the 
      degree of problem orientation of the medical record system can improve the 
      accuracy of recording of diagnoses and, therefore, the accuracy of using 
      routinely collected data from CMRs to determine the prevalence of diabetes 
      mellitus; data processing strategies should reflect the degree of problem 
      orientation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The world's poorest 2 billion people, benefit from no more than about 
      3.5% of the world's operative procedures. The burden of surgical disease is 
      greatest in Africa, where operations could save many lives. Previous 
      facility-based studies have described operative procedure caseloads, but 
      prospective studies investigating interventions, indications and perioperative 
      mortality rates (POMR), are rare. METHODS: A prospective, questionnaire-based 
      collection of data on all major and minor operative procedures was undertaken at 
      2 hospitals in rural Uganda covering 4 and 3 months in 2011, respectively. Data 
      included patient characteristics, indications for the interventions performed, 
      and outcome after surgery. RESULTS: We recorded 2,790 operative procedures on 
      2,701 patients. The rate of major operative procedures per 100,000 population per 
      year was 225. Patients undergoing major operative procedures (n = 1,051) were 
      mostly women (n = 923; 88%) because most interventions were performed owing to 
      pregnancy-related complications (n = 747; 67%) or gynecologic conditions (n = 
      114; 10%). General operative interventions registered included herniorrhaphy (n = 
      103; 9%), exploratory laparotomy (n = 60; 5%), and appendectomy (n = 31; 3%). The 
      POMR for major operative procedures was 1% (n = 14) and was greatest after 
      exploratory laparotomy (13%; n = 8) and caesarean delivery (1%; n = 4). Most 
      deaths (n = 16) were a result of sepsis (n = 10-11) or hemorrhage (n = 3-5). 
      CONCLUSION: The volume of surgery was low relative to the size of the catchment 
      population. The POMR was high. Exploratory laparotomy and caesarean section were 
      identified as high-risk procedures. Increased availability of blood, improved 
      perioperative monitoring, and early intervention could be part of a solution to 
      reduce the POMR.

TI  - Toward a standard approach to measurement and reporting of perioperative 
      mortality rate as a global indicator for surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The proportion of patients who die during or after surgery, 
      otherwise known as the perioperative mortality rate (POMR), is a credible 
      indicator of the safety and quality of operative care. Its accuracy and 
      usefulness as a metric, however, particularly one that enables valid comparisons 
      over time or between jurisdictions, has been limited by lack of a standardized 
      approach to measurement and calculation, poor understanding of when in relation 
      to surgery it is best measured, and whether risk-adjustment is needed. Our aim 
      was to evaluate the value of POMR as a global surgery metric by addressing these 
      issues using 4, large, mixed, surgical datasets that represent high-, middle-, 
      and low-income countries. METHODS: We obtained data from the New Zealand National 
      Minimum Dataset, the Geelong Hospital patient management system in Australia, and 
      purpose-built surgical databases in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, and Port 
      Moresby, Papua New Guinea. For each site, we calculated the POMR overall as well 
      as for nonemergency and emergency admissions. We assessed the effect of admission 
      episodes and procedures as the denominator and the difference between in-hospital 
      POMR and POMR, including postdischarge deaths up to 30 days. To determine the 
      need for risk-adjustment for age and admission urgency, we used univariate and 
      multivariate logistic regression to assess the effect on relative POMR for each 
      site. RESULTS: A total of 1,362,635 patient admissions involving 1,514,242 
      procedures were included. More than 60% of admissions in Pietermaritzburg and 
      Port Moresby were emergencies, compared with less than 30% in New Zealand and 
      Geelong. Also, Pietermaritzburg and Port Moresby had much younger patient 
      populations (P < .001). A total of 8,655 deaths were recorded within 30 days, and 
      8-20% of in-hospital deaths occurred on the same day as the first operation. 
      In-hospital POMR ranged approximately 9-fold, from 0.38 per 100 admissions in New 
      Zealand to 3.44 per 100 admissions in Pietermaritzburg. In New Zealand, 
      in-hospital 30-day POMR underestimated total 30-day POMR by approximately one 
      third. The difference in POMR if procedures were used instead of admission 
      episodes ranged from 7 to 70%, although this difference was less when central 
      line and pacemaker insertions were excluded. Age older than 65 years and 
      emergency admission had large, independent effects on POMR but relatively little 
      effect in multivariate analysis on the relative odds of in-hospital death at 
      each site. CONCLUSION: It is possible to collect POMR in countries at all level 
      of development. Although age and admission urgency are strong, independent 
      associations with POMR, a substantial amount of its variance is site-specific and 
      may reflect the safety of operative and anesthetic facilities and processes. 
      Risk-adjustment is desirable but not essential for monitoring system performance. 
      POMR varies depending on the choice of denominator, and in-hospital deaths appear 
      to underestimate 30-day mortality by up to one third. Standardized approaches to 
      reporting and analysis will strengthen the validity of POMR as the principal 
      indicator of the safety of surgery and anesthesia care.

TI  - Perioperative mortality rate (POMR): a global indicator of access to safe surgery 
      and anaesthesia.
PG  - 856-64
LID - 10.1007/s00268-014-2638-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The unmet global burden of surgical disease is substantial. 
      Currently, two billion people do not have access to emergency and essential 
      surgical care. This results in unnecessary deaths from injury, infection, 
      complications of pregnancy, and abdominal emergencies. Inadequately treated 
      surgical disease results in disability, and many children suffer deformity 
      without corrective surgery. METHODS: A consensus meeting was held between 
      representatives of Surgical and Anaesthetic Colleges and Societies to obtain 
      agreement about which indicators were the most appropriate and credible. The 
      literature and state of national reporting of perioperative mortality rates was 
      reviewed by the authors. RESULTS: There is a need for a credible national and/or 
      regional indicator that is relevant to emergency and essential surgical care. We 
      recommend introducing the perioperative mortality rate (POMR) as an indicator of 
      access to and safety of surgery and anaesthesia. POMR should be measured at two 
      time periods: death on the day of surgery and death before discharge from 
      hospital or within 30 days of the procedure, whichever is sooner. The rate should 
      be expressed as the number of deaths (numerator) over the number of procedures 
      (denominator). The option of before-discharge or 30 days is practical for those 
      low- to middle-income countries where postdischarge follow-up is likely to be 
      incomplete, but it allows those that currently can report 30-day mortality rates 
      to continue to do so. Clinical interpretation of POMR at a hospital or health 
      service level will be facilitated by risk stratification using age, urgency 
      (elective and emergency), procedure/procedure group, and the American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists grade. CONCLUSIONS: POMR should be reported as a health 
      indicator by all countries and regions of the world. POMR reporting is feasible, 
      credible, achieves a consensus of acceptance for reporting at national level. 
      Hospital and Service level POMR requires interpretation using simple measures of 
      risk adjustment such as urgency, age, the condition being treated or the 
      procedure being performed and ASA status.

TI  - Modeling problem-oriented clinical notes.
PG  - 507-15
LID - 10.3414/ME11-01-0064 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop a model as a starting-point for developing a 
      problem-oriented clinical notes application as a generic component of an 
      Electronic Health Record (EHR). METHODS: We used the generic conceptualization of 
      Weed's problem-oriented medical record (POMR) to link progress notes to problems, 
      and the Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP) headings to classify 
      elements of these notes. Health Level 7 (HL7) Version 3 and Unified Modeling 
      Language (UML) were used for modeling. We looked especially at the role of 
      Conditions and Concerns, and how to model these to document clinical reasoning. 
      RESULTS: We developed a generic HL7-based model for progress notes. In this model 
      the specific clinical note has a condition as its reason. An assertion can be 
      made about a condition. Any condition, observation or procedure can be a concern 
      that has to be tracked. Utmost important is the relationship between constituting 
      parts of a progress note and specially between progress notes by linking a 
      progress note to conditions that are part of an earlier progress note. From this 
      model a comprehensive hierarchical condition tree can be built. Several views, 
      such as chronological, SOAP and condition-oriented, are possible. The clinical 
      notes application is used in daily clinical practice. The model meets explicit 
      design criteria and clinical needs. CONCLUSIONS: With the comprehensive HL7 
      standard it is possible to model and map progress notes using SOAP headings and 
      POMR methodology. We have developed a generic, flexible and applicable paradigm 
      by using acts for each assessment that refer to a condition (1), by separating 
      conditions from concerns (2), and by an extensive use of the working list act 
      (3).

TI  - The value of postoperative MR in tethered cord: a review of 140 cases.
PG  - 2159-62
LID - 10.1007/s00381-011-1578-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the justification for routine 
      postoperative MRI (POMR) following surgical release of tethered cord (TC) given 
      that an MR, in this situation, mostly serves as a baseline and rarely has 
      immediate clinical implications. Furthermore, later in the course of the disease, 
      the presence of retethering is mostly assessed by clinical parameters, rather 
      than imaging. METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of patients who 
      underwent tethered cord release surgery between the years 1997 and 2009 at the 
      Department of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Tel Aviv Medical Center, Israel was 
      performed. Collected data including basis for diagnosis, pathology, associated 
      clinical and radiologic findings, surgical procedure and outcome, postoperative 
      follow-up and morbidities, and postoperative MRI findings were recorded and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred forty patients operated upon between 1997 and 2009 
      for tethered cord syndrome were reviewed. Routine postoperative MR was performed 
      in all cases 6-18 months after surgery. All cases were fully untethered. MR 
      revealed relevant information in eight cases, two with residual dermoid, and six 
      with significant terminal syrinx. None of these findings led to repeat surgery or 
      special treatment. Retethering operations were performed in two cases in which 
      retethering was diagnosed based on clinical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 
      analysis of our series of 140 consecutive patients who all underwent POMR 
      6-18 months after TC release, we suggest that POMR as routine clinical practice 
      is not justified for uncomplicated cases of TC release. In cases of high risk for 
      retethering, or significant preoperative syrinx or dermoid, POMR is recommended 
      to establish a baseline for future clinical follow-up.

TI  - National patient flow framework: an ontological patient-oriented redesign.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - This study introduces the necessary ontological redesign regarding 
      patient-oriented frameworks. Different national healthcare frameworks around the 
      world as well as semantic gaps have been discovered and demonstrate the need for 
      a new healthcare management framework. This study's Patient-Oriented Management 
      and Reporting framework (POMR framework) will introduce and measure the concept 
      of value-added, patient-oriented flow. The ontological introduction of leading 
      patient-oriented measures is also considered as a novel approach to solving 
      problems. These measures are included in this POMR framework which introduces a 
      unique ontological model redesign (POMR model) and its patient-oriented 
      supporting information system (POMRS) adding value to the concept's 
      implementation in CLIPS technology.

TI  - The nodes focusing tool for clinical course data of hypergraph structure in the 
      ontological framework CSX output from POMR-based EMR system.
PG  - 741-5
AB  - Knowledge management is one of the significant issues in this century. In medical 
      informatics, the concept of ontology is an important current topic. In addition, 
      there is great interest in knowledge acquisition from clinical data. When doctors 
      use clinical information systems (CIS), their operation implicitly represents, to 
      some extent, their thinking processes with clear reasons and goals according to 
      their intent. If we can capture such resources in an appropriate representation, 
      considerable empirical knowledge could be utilized in various research fields. 
      With this prospect, the authors built an experimental CIS and a nodes-focusing 
      tool for abstracting a summary of the clinical course being examined. The 
      information model is based on a thinking process model, and data are represented 
      in the ontological framework CSX. Then we showed the knowledge-abstracting 
      procedures with this tool. Some domain experts and intern students showed great 
      interest. The authors thereby concluded that such an empirical knowledge 
      acquisition environment is useful for research, education, and so on.

TI  - Are problem-oriented medial records (POMR) suitable for use in GPs' daily 
      practice?
PG  - 68-72
AB  - Problem-oriented functions have been implemented in almost all Belgian GPs' 
      software systems since 2003. We therefore investigated whether some of them - 
      especially the explicit linking procedure between treatments or referrals and the 
      relevant problems - can be used by GPs in their current daily practice. In 2005, 
      within the Belgian ResoPrim project, we organized data collection, mainly around 
      the theme of "hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors", by 26 volunteer GPs' 
      practices using three different software systems. Data were collected 
      prospectively over six weeks in early 2005, and retrospectively for 2004. In this 
      paper we report only on the part of the study that aimed to assess the linking 
      procedure. For all patients and hypertensive patients alike, the key indicators 
      used were the percentage of (problem-) linked drugs among the drugs extracted, 
      the percentage of anti-hypertensive (problem-) linked drugs among 
      anti-hypertensive drugs extracted, and the percentage of (problem-) linked 
      referrals among the number of referrals extracted. For all patients, the data 
      collected relate to 10,914 contacts (7,831 patients) in 2005, and to 74,878 
      contacts (16,813 patients) in 2004. Large variations were observed per software 
      system and GP, and also over time. The percentage of linked drugs rose from 2% 
      (2004, two GPs) to 36% (2005, fourteen GPs). For linked referrals the percentage 
      was 65% in 2004 vs. 75% in 2005. Our study shows that some functions related to 
      the problem-oriented patient record were spontaneously used by GPs in daily 
      practice. This use increased during collaboration with the primary care research 
      network. This increase was not restricted to the theme of data collection (i.e. 
      not restricted to hypertensive patients, to anti-hypertensive drugs or to links 
      with cardiovascular problems).

TI  - Evaluation of a computerized problem-oriented medical record in a hospital 
      department: does it support daily clinical practice?
PG  - 592-600
AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of a computerized problem-oriented medical record (CPOMR) for 
      health care work. METHODS: A qualitative study of the daily use of a CPOMR at an 
      internal medicine hospital ward over a period of 3 months, during which 66 
      patients were treated based on clinical information recorded in the CPOMR though 
      back up by a paper-based record was available. The study is based on participant 
      observation and interviews with the clinicians who had the most profound and 
      extensive experience in the use of the CPOMR. Before and during the test-period 
      the author attended project planning meetings, a training workshop in the use of 
      the CPOMR for nurses and physicians and local coordination meetings. After the 
      test, one focus-group discussion with physicians and nurses (6 participants; 
      duration 11/2h) was conducted as well as 13 open-ended interviews (5 nurses, 2 
      social and health assistants, 4 physicians, 2 IT-people; duration: 16-42 min; 
      average of 29 min). The interviewees formed the core group using the CPOMR. 
      RESULTS: Use of the CPOMR led to more time spent documenting clinical work, 
      fragmentation of patient situation into separate problems, and lack of an 
      overview. CONCLUSION: The problem-oriented method for structuring a computerized 
      medical record may provide a description of how physicians think or ought to 
      think, but does not adequately support complex clinical work. While the CPOMR can 
      be used for patients with few, simple problems who are admitted for only a short 
      time, it is not useful for patients with a complex set of problems or for 
      patients admitted for longer periods of time. This is in accordance with 
      criticism of the paper-based POMR, the problematic points of which do not seem to 
      be alleviated through computerization. The problem-oriented way of ordering 
      information should be accompanied by a source- and time-oriented approach.

TI  - Viewpoint: patient-centered medical care requires a patient-centered medical 
      record.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - If patient-centered medicine is to become a widespread reality in academic 
      medical centers, educational initiatives must include reform of the medical 
      record. The medical record is part of the hidden, or informal, curriculum of 
      medical school and residency that defines for students and residents the 
      essential ingredients of competent medical care. Whatever its merits, the 
      conventional, problem-oriented medical record (POMR) is a pathology-oriented 
      record that helps perpetuate a disease-focused, biomedical model of practice 
      Patient-centered medicine requires a patient-centered medical record (PCMR), one 
      that addresses the person and perspective of the patient as competently as it 
      addresses the patient's disease. The author proposes a PCMR that includes a 
      concise, upfront Patient Profile; speaks of "chief concerns," not "chief 
      complaints"; makes Patient Perspective a captioned component of the History of 
      Present Illness; replaces the POMR's formula SOAP (Subjective, Objective, 
      Assessment, Plan) with HOAP (History, Observations, Assessment, Plan); includes 
      important patient perspectives on the Problem List; and calls for additional, 
      written attention to the person and perspective of the patient throughout the 
      course of medical care Patient-centered records can guide and teach clinicians at 
      every level of training and experience to practice patient-centered medicine. 
      Moreover, such records can also provide measurable evidence that this teaching 
      has been successful.

TI  - Implications of the problem orientated medical record (POMR) for research using 
      electronic GP databases: a comparison of the Doctors Independent Network Database 
      (DIN) and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD).
PG  - 14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The General Practice Research Database (GPRD) and Doctor's 
      Independent Network Database (DIN), are large electronic primary care databases 
      compiled in the UK during the 1990s. They provide a valuable resource for 
      epidemiological and health services research. GPRD (based on VAMP) presents notes 
      as a series of discrete episodes, whereas DIN is based on a system (MEDITEL) that 
      used a Problem Orientated Medical Record (POMR) which links prescriptions to 
      diagnostic problems. We have examined the implications for research of these 
      different underlying philosophies. METHODS: Records of 40,183 children from 141 
      practices in DIN and 76,310 from 464 practices in GRPD who were followed to age 5 
      were used to compare the volume of recording of prescribing and diagnostic codes 
      in the two databases. To assess the importance and additional value of the POMR 
      within DIN, the appropriateness of diagnostic linking to skin emollient 
      prescriptions was investigated. RESULTS: Variation between practices for both the 
      number of days on which prescriptions were issued and diagnoses were recorded was 
      marked in both databases. Mean number of "prescription days" during the first 5 
      years of life was similar in DIN (19.5) and in GPRD (19.8), but the average 
      number of "diagnostic days" was lower in DIN (15.8) than in GPRD (22.9). 
      Adjustment for linkage increased the average "diagnostic days" to 23.1 in DIN. 
      32.7% of emollient prescriptions in GPRD appeared with an eczema diagnosis on the 
      same day compared to only 19.4% in DIN; however, 86.4% of prescriptions in DIN 
      were linked to an earlier eczema diagnosis. More specifically 83% of emollient 
      prescriptions appeared under a problem heading of eczema in the 121 practices 
      that were using problem headings satisfactorily. CONCLUSION: Prescribing records 
      in DIN and GPRD are very similar, but the usage of diagnostic codes is more 
      parsimonious in DIN because of its POMR structure. Period prevalence rates will 
      be underestimated in DIN unless this structure is taken into account. The 
      advantage of the POMR is that in 121 of 141 practices using problem headings as 
      intended, most prescriptions can be linked to a problem heading providing a 
      specific reason for their issue.

      patient record.
PG  - 313-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To overcome some classical limitations of the POMR (Problem-Oriented 
      Medical Record), including the management of divergent opinions between health 
      professionals, in order to construct a common patient record across multiple 
      disciplines in hospital settings and professional networks. METHODS: Using a 
      complex clinical case, we improved a POMR model previously used by GPs in order 
      to translate it into a hospital setting. The enhanced model has been assessed 
      through use in various ongoing clinical cases and through extended discussion 
      with professional end-users (physicians, nurses, general practitioners, and 
      social workers). RESULTS: The Index concept (flexible structural link) is 
      proposed as a major improvement in the construction of a POMR in a shared care 
      environment. CONCLUSIONS: The Index introduces interesting new perspectives. 
      Following its implementation in the Belgian pilot site in the CORINES project, 
      further studies remain to be carried out in order to develop a cost/benefit 
      assessment.

TI  - The application of a computerized problem-oriented medical record system and its 
      impact on patient care.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - The present computer system is the first of its kind based on problem-oriented 
      medical record (POMR) design developed and operated in a hospital in Hong Kong. 
      It went live in May 1996 with two workstations installed in the medical record 
      office (MRO). Doctors have no direct access to it. They dictate medical notes on 
      tape using either structured or free dictation format, and the tape is brought to 
      the MRO for processing. The principal aim of this study is to study the impact of 
      the computer system on patient care. Retrospective review of medical records and 
      in-depth interviews were conducted to study the quality of medical records and 
      doctor's opinions. A total of 400 manual and 398 computerized patient records 
      were randomly selected for review. The completeness of the manual notes and 
      computerized notes using free dictation format were about the same. The 
      computerized records using structured dictation format may be more complete than 
      those using free dictation format. The in-depth interview shows that most doctors 
      preferred structured medical records but some disagreed with too detailed a level 
      of structuring. They were not familiar with POMR, and some even thought that 
      breaking down the record by problem was not possible. All felt that the present 
      system would not directly affect patient care, but some said that it would 
      facilitate research. In conclusion, since the utility of the information mainly 
      depends on the doctors' efforts, commitment to the agreed structure and 
      subsequent routine audit of computerized medical records are essential to make 
      sure that diagnoses are accurately coded and information is correctly structured.

TI  - Problem focused knowledge navigation: implementing the problem focused medical 
      record and the O-HEAP note.
PG  - 325-9
AB  - The current organization of most Computerized Medical Records (CMR) is based on 
      the Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) and the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, 
      Assessment and Plan) note. The organizational structure of the POMR and 
      especially the SOAP note, does not allow for optimal use of computer capabilities 
      in the follow up note. Since follow up visits are the most common office visit by 
      far, this is a major flaw in the CMR. The authors propose a Problem Focused 
      Medical Record and the OHEAP (Orientation, History, Exam, Assessment and Plan) 
      note to resolve this problem. OHEAP starts with a powerful orientation structure 
      that brings forward the timeline, last Assessment and Plan, and Plan Results for 
      each problem along with the patient's historical tables as the starting point of 
      every follow up visit. The Assessment and Plan portion brings problem specific 
      differential diagnoses and their workups along with other relevant tables such as 
      expert systems, treatments, instructions, medical literature or pathways. This 
      leads to Problem Focused Knowledge Navigation that brings powerful efficiencies 
      to the CMR. By recognizing the true workflow in the longitudinal diagnosis and 
      management of any medical problem, the efficiency of the CMR is maximized. OHEAP 
      allows for optimal use of both personal and external data elements in the medical 
      record. Its powerful orientation attributes minimize the time spent in analyzing 
      the current status of the problem while its connections to problem specific 
      databases help resolve the problem.

TI  - Taking the problem oriented medical record forward.
PG  - 463-7
AB  - The problem oriented medical record (POMR) has proved to be very successful in 
      providing a structure that helps doctors record their notes about patients, and 
      view those notes subsequently in a manner that quickly gives them a good 
      understanding of that patients history. This approach has been validated by the 
      American Institute of Medicine. With the increased use of computer systems that 
      implement the POMR by doctors, the limitations of this structure have become 
      apparent, and there is clearly scope for developing the model further to improve 
      the quality of the data recorded, and adding meaning to it. This paper describes 
      some of the limitations of the POMR, and discusses a number of areas in which it 
      may be extended. Crucially, this is done in a manner which is both implementable, 
      and usable. The extensions explored include some types of entity including 
      encounters, episodes and subproblems; and an alternative view-the Timeline. The 
      terminology used for the extensions is clarified. Mechanisms by which these 
      extensions have been implemented are described. Ways in which systems can manage 
      these extensions automatically are suggested. Such implementations are 
      constrained by the need not to allow the demands of the computer to intrude into 
      the patient encounter. They are also constrained by the requirements for 
      reporting by professional and governmental institutions, and by what is 
      pragmatically feasible in software and hardware.

PG  - 249-52
AB  - A new design for an electronic medical record with flexible template generation 
      was developed. The "template" in this paper refers to one of the tools that calls 
      a user's attention to entering the data items for each problem or to ordering 
      tests when they are due. The template shows the patient's previous data and 
      guides physicians to record the consistent description. Two kinds of medical data 
      dictionaries are prepared. Data representations of signs, symptoms, laboratory 
      tests, and other examinations are defined in the check items dictionary. The 
      problem dictionary contains the possible patient problems with relation to check 
      items and other kinds of related subjects. This system provides Problem Oriented 
      Medical Record (POMR) and the graphical presentation of various patient data. The 
      system was designed to establish a constant and integrated medical record.

TI  - ASOP: a new method and tools for capturing a clinical encounter.
PG  - 142-6
AB  - ASOP is a proposed method for future medical record notation. This permutation of 
      the original POMR-SOAP method is necessary to provide the standardized workflow 
      and medical nomenclature which will be essential for automated medical record 
      systems and forms-based encounter recording. The development of an ASOP system is 
      dependent on tools to map assessment to appropriate terminology within a 
      universal medical dictionary and generate intelligent queries across the 
      World-Wide-Web. In this study we intend to demonstrate the need for change in the 
      POMR system and highlight some of the current tools in development to make the 
      ASOP method the medical record notation system of choice.

TI  - Formal representation of a conceptual data model for the patient-based medical 
      record.
PG  - 466-70
AB  - We present a general architecture for the patient-based medical record as it is 
      being developed for the SAMS, a private social security system. The conceptual 
      data model is described in a convenient formal notation, the entity-relationship 
      diagram. Although following the original formulation of the problem-oriented 
      medical record (POMR), the data model was designed with a level of generalization 
      that, functionally, makes structural differences between conventional and POMR no 
      longer apparent. The main features of this model are its adaptability to 
      individual work practices and its problem-oriented structure, including the 
      representation of problems' evolution. This structure will enable physicians to 
      organize the data, mostly collected elsewhere, by explicitly relating the facts 
      that constitute a particular patient record, which is a simple way to store 
      context information and clinical knowledge that is not part of patient data.

      Time-Oriented Record (STOR) System.
PG  - 581-7
AB  - Advances in microcomputer hardware and software technology have made computerised 
      outpatient medical records practical. We have developed a programme based on the 
      Summary Time-Oriented Record (STOR) system which complements existing paper-based 
      record keeping. The elements of the Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR) System 
      are displayed in two windows within one screen, namely, the SOAP (Subjective 
      information, Objective information, Assessments and Plans) elements in the Reason 
      For Encounter (RFE) window and the problem list with outcomes in the Problem List 
      (PL) window. Context sensitive child windows display details of plans of 
      management in the RFE window and clinical notes in the PL window. The benefits of 
      such innovations to clinical decision making and practice based research and its 
      medico-legal implications are discussed.

TI  - A comparison of two methods for facilitating clinical data integration by medical 
      students.
PG  - 333-40
AB  - Two important charting strategies to help students organize patients' data are 
      Weed's problem-oriented medical record (POMR) and Russell's condition diagram 
      (CD). The authors conducted the present study in 1987 to determine whether either 
      was superior for clinical data integration. Sophomore medical students at The 
      University of Texas Medical School at San Antonio indicated whether they 
      preferred the POMR, the CD, or neither. They were then divided into three study 
      groups according to their preferences, with the POMR and CD groups receiving 80 
      hours of training and the control group receiving only the standard preclinical 
      training. Each student then examined a standardized patient and wrote an 
      open-ended report about the patient's medical problem. After examining a second 
      patient, students were asked to write a structured report providing information 
      about each of ten components of diagnosis. Both the CD and the POMR groups scored 
      numerically higher on the structured type of report than did the controls, but 
      only the CD group scored significantly higher. The CD group also scored higher 
      than did the POMR group on both types of report, but the differences were not 
      statistically significant. This study indicates that the clinical reasoning of 
      medical students can be enhanced by focused training in either the CD or the POMR 
      methods. It suggests that the CD format may be particularly helpful for students 
      with lower academic achievement.

AB  - I have attempted to use Feinstein's model of clinimetric indexes and his criteria 
      as a focus for further development of measures that in physical therapy are 
      currently considered "soft" or "subjective". I feel this development will enhance 
      the body of knowledge by objectifying a portion of clinical assessment (eg, the 
      patient's complaints, "subjective" portion of the POMR's SOAP format) that is in 
      tremendous need of quantification. By making these "soft" data "hard," I feel we 
      will enhance the decision-making power of clinicians.

AB  - The Weed System of Problem Orientated Medical Records (POMR) was first used by 
      medical staff in the psychogeriatric unit at Cefn Coed Hospital, Swansea in 1976. 
      In 1983, when the Nursing Process was introduced, it became apparent that both 
      systems are virtually identical. Although different terminology is used, each 
      contains four components--data collection, listing of problems, drawing up 
      management plans and establishing systematic reviews. This paper describes an 
      experiment, in progress for three years, which has joined both systems into a 
      unified method of working which is used by each member of the multidisciplinary 
      team.

      pharmacokinetics of drugs in animals. The Colorado State University at Fort 
      Collins has developed an elective one-week rotation for pharmacy students through 
      the University Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The four objectives of the program 
      are: (1) to observe the various aspects of veterinary medicine and its use in 
      different animal species; (2) to work with the student of veterinary medicine to 
      plan and evaluate a drug therapy course; (3) to understand species variance in 
      absorption, metabolism, and elimination of drugs; and (4) to plan and evaluate a 
      course of therapy for an assigned animal, using the Problem Oriented Medical 
      Record (POMR) format.

AB  - Herein we describe an innovative, computerized version of Problem Oriented 
      Medical Records (POMR). This expanded variation of the Weed system is currently 
      being used by primary care physicians on a regular basis with excellent results. 
      The method is an extension of the POMR system of keeping medical records, 
      augmented in the manner of McDonald for computer-generated reminders. Separate 
      files are maintained for the patients, the diagnoses, and the medications. At 
      each patient "encounter," reminders from the diagnosis file are printed for each 
      active diagnosis for the patient. These reminders are grouped into initial data 
      bases and follow-up data bases. For each "diagnosis-specific data base," both 
      subjective and objective reminders are printed. Similarly, follow-up data 
      reminders for medication surveillance are displayed.

AB  - Objective assessment of the delivery of care requires an unambiguous record of 
      all related events and decisions in the care process. Both the handwritten 
      Problem-Oriented Medical Record (POMR) and its computerized successor, the 
      Problem Oriented Medical Information System (PROMIS) have been designed to 
      facilitate audit of care delivery. In this study, a national sample of physicians 
      was asked to determine which of these two record systems best serves the function 
      of audit. The study involves assessment of a sample of 69 matched pairs of 
      patient records drawn from two different ward settings, one of which used the 
      manual POMR, the other, PROMIS. No difference was perceived between the two 
      records with respect to the reliability of information or the analytical 
      reasoning of providers. Information in PROMIS records was judged to be slightly 
      more thorough. The format of the manual record was judged better on the basis of 
      conciseness, accessibility, and organization of record information.

TI  - Brain injury rehabilitation: standard problem lists.
PG  - 223-7
AB  - Numerous problem lists have been developed since the introduction of the 
      Problem-Oriented Medical Record (POMR). General medical, surgical, psychiatric 
      and rehabilitation settings have been found to be appropriate for the POMR 
      system. The development of a standard problem list for use in brain injury 
      rehabilitation and its application in a typical case are described. The 
      standardized list is believed to facilitate efficient identification of problems 
      and of specific treatment plans and to provide a more uniform approach to 
      evaluation of progress. However, the development of a problem list involves some 
      difficulties in the evaluation of the validity and reliability of criteria used 
      to determine the presence or absence of a problem, in the tendency to generate an 
      unnecessarily lengthy list, and in the achievement of agreement regarding 
      terminology.

TI  - [A practical clinical record system for the general practitioner].
PG  - 1119-24
AB  - Owing to the multidisciplinary character of general practice, there is a great 
      need for an effective and practical clinical record system for the family 
      physician. The recording of clinical data of home visits and other visits places 
      an extra burden on his record system. A practical system which tries to solve 
      these and other problems is presented. A simplified form of Weed's Problem 
      Orientated Medical Records (POMR) is incorporated in this system. The different 
      components as well as the practical functioning of the system are described.

AB  - The subject of medical records is not popular with clinicians these days. Having 
      to see patients in the clinic without their notes is too common an experience, 
      and one which raises the blood pressure of both doctor and patient. Paradoxically 
      though, it does force us reluctantly to concede that these maligned documents do 
      have a purpose. It might even persuade us that it is illogical to attach so much 
      importance to them when they are missing, and to treat them with such 
      indifference when they are not.

PG  - 11-4
AB  - An approach to quality assurance in the physiotherapy department of the 
      University Hospital in London, Ontario, is presented. The importance of assessing 
      the quality of care is stressed. To reach a level at which quality can be 
      assessed, a system of recording must be developed, complete with guidelines; this 
      recording system can then be audited. A method of recording--the Problem Oriented 
      Method of Recording, or the Problem Oriented Medical Record (POMR)--and a method 
      of auditing are presented and discussed. Prospects for future audits are also 
      discussed. The importance of sharing knowledge with other physiotherapists, by 
      establishing criteria with which critical evaluation of physiotherapeutic 
      treatments can be performed, is pointed out.

TI  - Medical students, medical records and clinical skills.
PG  - 446-52
AB  - 140 Liverpool medical undergraduates from all three clinical years completed a 
      two part questionnaire. The first part gave their opinion on the contents of 
      medical case records and how they personally recorded and used them. The second 
      part showed the usefulness to students of their teachers' assessments of their 
      clinical skills. The results indicated that the present case record and 
      assessment of clinical skills were unhelpful in the students' education. The type 
      of record-keeping which students thought best was very similar to the 
      problem-orientated medical record (POMR). The kind of assessment of clinical 
      skills which they would like was very similar to the educational audit linked 
      with POMR. In view of these findings, the introduction of POMR into the 
      undergraduate curriculum is strongly advocated.

TI  - The effect of problem-oriented medical records on clinical management controlled 
      for patient risks.
PG  - 476-87
AB  - This study examines the change in clinical management by 28 medical and surgical 
      firms in three London teaching hospitals following the introduction of 
      Problem-Oriented Medical Records (POMR) in one of the hospitals. Comparison is 
      made between firms using and not using POMR. The data are analyzed using a 
      regression model. Analysis is based on the coefficient of change in each firm 
      between the two study years when modified by the physiological and demographic 
      patient variables significantly associated with the management of each disease. 
      Although not conclusive, the results in four of the seven diseases studied 
      encourage the speculation that POMR may have improved the thoroughness of patient 
      management. The significant patient variables in each diagnosis suggest that 
      patient risk on admission can affect management scores. Were this to be found 
      elsewhere, the influences of patient mix might be considered in using explicit 
      criteria to make comparisons between hospitals that serve different kinds of 
      populations.

TI  - The problem-oriented medical record: modification and simplification for 
      rehabilitation medicine.
PG  - 1383-5
AB  - A modified POMR has been formulated for use in rehabilitation medicine. It 
      incorporates the concept of the Weed system, modifies rehabilitation problems 
      into seven functional categories, and modifies the problem-oriented progress 
      note. It uses a problem-oriented team conference and a functional status form. 
      These modifications, I believe, improve patient care, medical education, and 
      facilitate the medical audit.

TI  - Problem-oriented medical record: experience in 238 rehabilitation institutions.
PG  - 398-401
AB  - Since Lawrence Weed introduced the Problem-Oriented Medical Record (POMR) nine 
      years ago, several individual rehabilitation institutions have reported their 
      experiences with POMR. As the author was interested in learning of the 
      experiences of other rehabilitation institutions throughout the United States, 
      questionnaires were sent to 253 such institutions. Replies were received from 238 
      (94%), 132 University-Affiliated Departments of Physical Medicine and 
      Rehabilitation (UAD) and 106 Free-Standing Rehabilitation Centers (FSRC). Some 
      experience with POMR was reported by 155 institutions (65.1%), including 94 
      (39.5%) which currently use POMR. A comparison between UAD and FSRC revealed 
      statistically significant differences in experience with POMR, the use of POMR 
      for medical and rehabilitation problems, the use of functional evaluation systems 
      and POMR, and professional areas of responsibility. There were no statistically 
      significant differences between UAD and FSRC in the use of POMR for medical 
      audit, the need for formal workshops to orient staff to POMR concepts, the 
      advantages of POMR, and the principal reason an institution was not using POMR. 
      The implications of these findings for patient care, medical education, record 
      keeping, and research are discussed in detail.

TI  - Multi-script modification of the medication list of the POMR.
PG  - 131-3
AB  - One solution to the multiplicity of entries required for a complete 
      Problem-Oriented Medical Record is a prescription blank which duplicates itself 
      when overlaid on a medication list of corresponding format by the use of 
      contact-activvated self-printing carbon paper. Used in a large group practice at 
      Fort Sill, such a form yields an exact duplicate of all prescriptions 
      sequentially for validation of prescription information, and accurate, current 
      information on medication in use, while decreasing physician writing time by 
      approximately one half. Screening for drug interactions and for overuse of abuse 
      of medications becomes almost automatic, as the medication list is always before 
      the physician during the writing of all prescriptions.

TI  - Tools for the Job: The POMR in Preventive Medicine.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - There is increasing interest in practical preventive care in the family doctor's 
      office. The concepts underlying the problem oriented medical record (POMR) 
      include the principles of preventive medicine, and it is thus an excellent 
      vehicle for implementation. However, the classical POMR model must be modified to 
      the context of family practice, and priorities defined by each practice.This 
      article describes how elements of the POMR can be used in planning preventive 
      care. An appraisal of one's own practice is a valuable part of the planning; 
      follow up can assess patient compliance and the effectiveness of the program.

TI  - The problem-oriented medical record: evaluation and management of anemia before 
      and during use.
PG  - 1119-1123
AB  - The problem-oriented medical record (POMR) is designed to rationalize and improve 
      the structure of the medical record. This change might be expected to enhance the 
      outcome of patient care. Therefore, I assessed the effect of the POMR on the care 
      of the problem--anemia--in a Veterans Administration teaching hospital. The POMR 
      concept was introduced by lectures and supported by chart audit. Four months 
      later, the care described in 29 sequential records containing the discharge 
      diagnosis--anemia--was compared with 31 records produced at the same period in 
      the previous year by house officers not using the POMR. Records were graded for 
      maintenance of the POMR format. Completeness of the "data base," as well as time 
      to problem identification, therapy, and diagnostic description were compared. 
      Introduction of the POMR had no observable beneficial effect on the thoroughness 
      of data base accumulation or the process of patient care for the problem (anemia) 
      or, in another study, on the ease or accuracy of chart audit.

TI  - Format review: evaluating implementation of the problem-oriented medical record.
PG  - 857-65
AB  - As interest in the problem-oriented medical record (POMR) develops, and more 
      medical settings begin to implement the system, many observers are expressing a 
      desire to know how well the system is being used and accepted. Moreover, settings 
      currently using the POMR system have a need to document the effectiveness of 
      their POMR program as a means of insuring continued progress and for addressing 
      difficulties and obstacles affecting its use. Format review is a technique for 
      reviewing patient records and describing patterns of POMR use. Patient records of 
      an institution are reviewed concurrent to the patient's contact with the 
      institution. Data collected from each record is summarized to provide an overview 
      on patterns of POMR use and to identify areas of difficulty. These findings can 
      serve as the basis for educational and administrative intervention to improve use 
      of POMR. The format review technique is explained and examples of its application 
      are given. The technique has been used at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical 
      Center over the past two years, and has proven to be a useful tool in describing 
      the implementation progress of POMR.

TI  - Use of problem-oriented medical record in psychiatry: a survey of 
      university-based residency training programs.
PG  - 700-3
AB  - A survey of university-based psychiatric residency training programs revealed 
      that nearly one-half of them use the problem-oriented medical record (POMR) and 
      that conversion to this system appears to be growing rapidly. Experiences with 
      the method have in general been positive. The author identifies factors 
      associated with successful operation of the POMR and suggests that an integrated, 
      hospital-wide adoption of the system may be crucial.

TI  - The use of problem-oriented medical records in community mental health centers.
PG  - 340-1
AB  - The authors' questionnaire survey of 147 community mental health centers revealed 
      that 36 (24%) were using problem-oriented medical records (POMR), 34 (23%) 
      planned to use them, 23 (16%) were uncertain and 54 (37%) had no considered using 
      them. According to the responses of centers that were using POMR and the authors' 
      experience, the advantages of POMR in psychiatry are similar to their advantages 
      in other specialties, and the difficulties in implementing this system are 
      related to the definition of "problems."

TI  - Cost analysis of leukemia treatment: a problem-oriented approach.
PG  - 646-52
AB  - A Problem Oriented List of Charges (POLC) can be used to obtain information about 
      the cost of treatment of a single medical problem in patients with several 
      coexisting medical problems. To prepare a POLC, each charge item is associated 
      with one of the patient's problems. POLCs were compiled from the Problem Oriented 
      Medical Records (POMRs) of patients with Acute Non-Lymphocytic Leukemic (ANLL). 
      From the POLCs at was apparent that the treatment of granulocytopenia and 
      thrombocytopenia and their sequelae were the most costly problems associated with 
      ANLL. The projected cost of treatment for all problems for 11.5 months (the 
      median survival of patients with ANLL treated with a single chemotherapeutic 
      agent at this institution) was $40,022. By extending the POMR into the area of 
      Medical reimbursement with a POLC, charge incurring activities can be coupled to 
      the results of patient care. Only by directly coupling, in the original medical 
      record, the reasons for, the charges for, and the results of medical care, can 
      cost data be appropriately interpreted.

TI  - Teaching problem-oriented recording: a systematic approach.
PG  - 959-64
AB  - Medical students and practitioners usually learn how to use problem-oriented 
      medical records (POMR) by haphazard means. In attempting to put system into the 
      teaching of POMR, the authors devised teaching case material and two 
      instructional formats: self-instruction and workshop. The results of a controlled 
      study with second-year medical students to determine the relative effectiveness 
      of instructional formats and case materials are presented. At the end of 
      instruction POMR performance was measured by assessing the student's ability to 
      convert a case to POMR format. The results suggest that all student groups 
      attained an acceptable performance level no matter which format they experienced.

PG  - 371-3
AB  - A psychiatric problem-oriented medical record designed for use by 
      multidisciplinary teams was introduced at Fairfield Hills Hospital in Newtown, 
      Connecticut, in 1972. The need for revision in the hospital's medical record 
      system had been pointed up by the development of the teams, which shared more 
      equally in responsibility for patient care, and by problems in meeting Medicare 
      standards. The authors describe the various forms that make up the POMR. Most of 
      the forms are completed by the teams in regularly scheduled conferences.

TI  - Non-physician development of problem lists from office records.
PG  - 211-2
AB  - It has been argued that conversion of office records to the problem-oriented 
      medical record entails a prohibitive cost in money and physician time. This study 
      reports an evaluation of the cost of preparing problem lists from existing 
      ambulatory patient records by non-physician personnel. The problem lists 
      constructed by non-physician personnel were judged by physicians to be accurate, 
      and the cost was much less than that required when physicians reviewed charts and 
      prepared problem lists themselves. The method described here is an accurate and 
      cost-effective way to begin conversion of outpatient records to P.O.M.R.

AB  - A comparative, two-stage between hospital study involving university 
      rehabilitation centers was undertaken to evaluate the impact of the problem 
      oriented medical record (POMR) on staff communication, attitude change and 
      decision making. Staff characteristics varied from one center to another. The 
      semantic differential component of the project did not reveal any change due to 
      the POMR in the staff perception of the medical record, the health care team or 
      the various health professions. However, team function with respect to the 
      management of specific patients improved in the centers which implemented the 
      POMR during the time period of the project.
